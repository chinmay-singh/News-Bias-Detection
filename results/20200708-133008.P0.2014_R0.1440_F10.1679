701299732
That O O 
means O O 
it O O

701299732
Not O O 
only O O 
that, O O

701299732
Once O O

Professor O O

while O O 
it O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
would O O 
be O O 
rather O O 
easy O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
for O O 
an O O

to O O 
contain O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
the O O 
disease O O 
in O O 
its O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice

form, O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
he Repetition Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
fears Repetition Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
that Repetition Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
it Repetition Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
could Repetition Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
evolve Appeal_to_fear-prejudice Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
into Appeal_to_fear-prejudice Appeal_to_fear-prejudice

“As O O 
with O O

it’s Repetition O

in O O 
the O O 
country’s O O 
worst O O

in O O 
50 O O 
years. O O 

706501640
Hunter, O O 
who O O 
is O O 
a O O 
disease O O 
expert O O 
at O O 
the O O 
University O O 
of O O 
East O O 
Anglia, O O 
told O O 
the O O 
Daily O O 
Star: O O 
“If O O 
it O O 
reaches O O 
the O O 
UK, O O 
Europe O O 
or O O 
the O O 
US O O 
it O O 
would O O 
be O O 
similar O O 
to O O 
the O O 
Ebola O O 
outbreak. O O 

706501640
We O O 
would O O 
have O O 
a O O 
few O O 
isolated O O 
cases O O 
but O O 
it O O 
shouldn’t O O 
spread O O 
like O O 
it O O 
has O O 
in O O 
Madagascar.” O O 
But O O 
he O O 
had O O 
more O O 
to O O 
add. O O 

706501640
While O O 
the O O 
bubonic O O 
plague O O 
is O O 
spread O O 
through O O 
the O O 
bites O O 
of O O 
infected O O 
fleas, O O 
pneumonic O O 
plague O O 
is O O 
spread O O 
through O O 
the O O 
air, O O 
usually O O 
by O O 
coughing. O O 

706501640
Symptoms O O 
of O O 
the O O 
plague O O 
include O O 
a O O 
very O O 
high O O 
fever, O O 
coughing O O 
(potentially O O 
coughing O O 
up O O 
blood), O O 
and O O 
headaches. O O 

706501640
The O O 
plague O O 
can O O 
be O O 
fatal O O 
24-48 O O 
hours O O 
after O O 
infection, O O 
but O O 
antibiotics O O 
will O O 
take O O 
care O O 
of O O 
the O O 
infection. O O 

706501640
Schools O O 
and O O 
universities O O 
have O O 
been O O 
closed O O 
with O O 
a O O 
ban O O 
issued O O 
on O O 
public O O 
gatherings, O O 
such O O 
as O O 
the O O 
tradition O O 
of O O 
“dancing O O 
with O O 
the O O 
dead” O O 
which O O 
has O O 
been O O 
partially O O 
blamed O O 
for O O 
the O O 
disease’s O O 
spread. O O 

706501640
The O O 
current O O

is O O 
also O O 
highly O O

730036755
At O O

after O O

a O O

Four O O

someone, O O

a O O

in O O

"Please O O

"He O O

730036755
A O O 
brief O O

from O O

says, O O 
"No O O

730036755
Candace O O

told O O

that O O 
he O O 
left O O 
when O O 
she O O

730036755
"Female O O

earlier O O 
in O O

730036755
Candace O O

according O O 
to O O 
the O O

730036755
Candace O O 
Smith O O 
also O O 
told O O 
officers O O 
that O O 
her O O 
husband O O 
had O O 
threatened O O 
to O O 
kill O O 
her, O O 
their O O 
daughter O O 
and O O 
himself O O 
if O O 
she O O 
left O O 
him. O O 

730036755
She O O 
said O O 
Smith O O 
always O O 
carried O O 
a O O 
gun O O 
despite O O 
being O O 
a O O 
convicted O O 
felon. O O 

730036755

when O O 
Quentin O O

called O O 
to O O 
complain O O 
that O O 
his O O

had O O 
locked O O 
him O O 
out O O

730036755
They O O 
were O O 
told O O 
to O O 
stay O O 
in O O 
separate O O 
areas O O 
of O O 
the O O

730036755
On O O 
Jan. O O

Quentin O O 
Smith's O O

“The O O

The O O 
UN O O

claims O O

any O O

of O O 
‘external O O

the O O

So O O 
where O O 
did O O 
the O O

come O O 
from, O O 
and O O 
who O O 
made O O 
them? O O 

718595845
According O O 
to O O 
Ritter: O O 

718595845
“Rather O O 
than O O 
the O O 
Iranian-manufactured O O 
Qiam-1 O O 
missiles O O 
Haley O O 
and O O 
the O O 
Saudi O O 
Arabian O O 
government O O 
claimed, O O 
the O O 
debris O O 
presented O O 
by O O 
Haley O O 
were O O 
of O O 
a O O 
modified O O 
Soviet-manufactured O O 
SCUD-B O O 
missile; O O 
the O O 
airframe O O 
and O O

are O O 
original O O 
Soviet-made O O

many O O 
of O O 
the O O 
smaller O O

on O O

bear O O 
Cyrillic O O 
(i.e., O O 
Russian) O O

718595845
The O O 
transformation O O 
to O O 
the O O 
Burkhan O O 
2-H O O 
design O O 
required O O 
the O O 
Houthi O O 
engineers O O 
to O O 
increase O O 
the O O 
size O O 
of O O 
the O O 
fuel O O 
and O O 
oxidizer O O 
tanks, O O 
and O O 
lengthen O O 
the O O 
airframe O O 
accordingly. O O 

718595845
This O O 
is O O 
done O O 
by O O 
cutting O O 
the O O 
airframe, O O 
and O O 
welding O O 
in O O 
place O O 
the O O 
appropriate O O 
segments O O 
(this O O 
also O O 
required O O 
that O O 
the O O 
fuel O O 
supply O O 
pipe, O O 
which O O 
passes O O 
through O O 
the O O 
oxidizer O O 
tank, O O 
be O O 
similarly O O 
lengthened.) O O 

718595845
The O O 
difference O O 
in O O 
quality O O 
between O O 
the O O 
factory O O 
welds O O 
and O O 
the O O 
new O O 
welds O O 
is O O 
readily O O 
discernable. O O 

718595845
The O O 
increased O O 
fuel O O 
supply O O 
permits O O 
a O O 
longer O O 
engine O O 
burn, O O 
which O O 
in O O 
turn O O 
increases O O 
the O O 
range O O 
of O O 
the O O 
missile. O O 

718595845
The O O

718595845
In O O 
January O O 
of O O 
this O O

a O O 
panel O O 
of O O 
U.N. O O 
experts O O 
stated: O O 

718595845
“The O O

[emphasis O O

718595845
The O O 
issues O O 
here O O 
go O O 
much O O 
deeper O O 
than O O 
nonsensical O O 
hypocrisy. O O 

718595845
According O O 
to O O 
Ritter, O O 
the O O 
entire O O 
debacle O O 
has O O 
shown O O 
that O O 
if O O 
Saudi O O 
Arabia O O 
cannot O O 
contain O O 
the O O 
Houthi’s O O 
missile O O 
capabilities, O O 
it O O 
cannot O O 
possibly O O 
hope O O 
to O O 
take O O 
on O O 
Iran, O O 
which O O 
possesses O O 
a O O 
significantly O O 
more O O 
advanced O O 
military O O 
than O O 
the O O 
Houthis O O 
do O O 
on O O 
their O O 
own. O O 

718595845
Ritter O O 
explains O O 
further: O O 

718595845
“If O O 
a O O

unsophisticated O O 
foe O O 
such O O 
as O O 
the O O 
Houthi, O O 
using O O

Soviet O O 
and O O 
North O O

derived O O 
from O O 
40-year-old O O 
technology, O O 
can O O 
evade O O

the O O 
political O O

718595845
The O O 
fact O O 
of O O 
the O O 
matter O O 
is O O 
that O O 
no O O

As O O 
uproar O O 
was O O 
building O O 
Tuesday O O 
over O O 
Wilson's O O 
efforts, O O 
the O O 
president O O 
tweeted O O 
that O O 
making O O 
plastic O O 
3D-printed O O

publicly O O 
available O O 
"doesn't O O 
seem O O 
to O O 
make O O 
much O O 
sense." O O 

776385494
White O O 
House O O 
spokeswoman O O 
Sarah O O 
Sanders O O 
elaborated O O 
Wednesday, O O 
saying O O 
the O O 
administration's O O 
Justice O O 
Department O O 
had O O 
acted O O 
on O O 
its O O 
own O O 
in O O 
granting O O 
Wilson O O 
permission O O 
to O O 
publish O O 
the O O 
blueprints O O 
on O O 
his O O 
Defcad O O 
website O O 
-- O O 
settling O O 
a O O 
five-year O O 
legal O O 
battle. O O 

776385494
"The O O 
Department O O 
of O O 
Justice O O 
made O O 
a O O 
deal O O 
without O O 
the O O 
president's O O 
approval," O O 
Sanders O O 
said. O O 

776385494
"The O O 
president's O O 
glad O O 
this O O 
effort O O 
was O O 
delayed O O 
to O O 
give O O 
more O O 
time O O 
to O O 
review O O 
the O O 
issue." O O 

776385494
Sanders O O 
also O O 
repeated O O 
the O O 
administration's O O 
claim O O 
from O O 
a O O 
day O O 
earlier O O 
that O O 
existing O O 
law O O 
already O O 
prohibits O O 
plastic O O 
firearms. O O 

776385494
The O O 
National O O 
Rifle O O 
Association, O O 
the O O 
nation's O O 
most O O 
politically O O 
influential O O 
gun O O 
rights O O 
group, O O 
echoed O O 
that O O 
claim, O O 
contending O O 
that O O 
the O O 
1988 O O 
law O O 
made O O 
the O O 
current O O 
3D-printed O O 
gun O O 
issue O O 
moot. O O 

776385494
"Regardless O O 
of O O 
what O O 
a O O 
person O O 
may O O 
be O O 
able O O 
to O O 
publish O O 
on O O 
the O O 
Internet, O O 
undetectable O O 
plastic O O 
guns O O 
have O O 
been O O 
illegal O O 
for O O 
30 O O 
years," O O 
the O O 
NRA O O 
said O O 
in O O 
a O O 
statement. O O 

776385494
But O O 
Wilson O O 
has O O 
gotten O O 
around O O 
the O O 
legal O O 
prohibition O O 
by O O 
providing O O 
instructions O O 
with O O 
the O O 
digital O O 
files O O 
for O O 
3D O O 
printing O O 
his O O 
"Liberator" O O 
plastic O O 
gun O O 
that O O 
call O O 
for O O 
an O O 
approximately O O 
six-ounce O O 
block O O 
of O O 
steel O O 
to O O 
be O O 
affixed O O 
to O O 
the O O 
weapon. O O 

776385494
Should O O 
those O O 
who O O 
print O O 
the O O 
gun O O 
follow O O 
those O O 
instructions, O O 
metal O O 
detectors O O 
would O O 
pick O O 
up O O 
the O O 
weapons, O O 
thus O O 
complying O O 
with O O 
the O O 
law. O O 

776385494
But O O 
while O O 
users O O 
can O O 
build O O 
the O O 
gun, O O 
there O O 
is O O 
no O O 
way O O 
to O O 
ensure O O 
they O O 
affix O O 
metal O O 
to O O 
it. O O

Late O O 
Tuesday, O O 
dozens O O

some O O

on O O

Wilson O O 
told O O

776385494
"This O O

776385494
Prior O O 
to O O

Wilson O O 
had O O 
actually O O 
been O O

declined O O

take O O 
up O O

776385494
But O O 
in O O 
a O O

(1) O O 
A O O

called O O 
upon O O 
to O O 
ask O O 
a O O 
question O O 
will O O 
ask O O 
a O O

question O O 
and O O

At O O 
the O O 
discretion O O 
of O O 
the O O 
President O O

White O O 
House O O 
official O O 
taking O O 
questions, O O 
a O O 
follow-up O O 
question O O 
or O O 
questions O O 
may O O 
be O O 
permitted; O O 
and O O 
where O O 
a O O 
follow O O 
up O O 
has O O 
been O O 
allowed O O 
and O O 
asked, O O 
the O O 
questioner O O 
will O O 
then O O 
yield O O 
the O O 
floor; O O 
(3) O O 
“Yielding O O 
the O O 
floor” O O 
includes, O O 
when O O

physically O O 
surrendering O O

Failure O O 
to O O 
abide O O 
by O O 
any O O 
of O O

(1)-(3) O O 
may O O 
result O O

If O O

for O O 
questions. O O

This O O 
is O O 
my O O 
advice O O

Senator O O 
Rand O O 
Paul O O 
(R-KY) O O 
has O O 
expressed O O 
some O O 
of O O 
my O O 
thoughts O O 
when O O 
it O O 
comes O O 
to O O 
the O O 
newly O O 
nominated O O 
Secretary O O

director O O 
of O O

Agency. O O 

740235127
Paul O O 
told O O 
CNN’s O O 
“State O O 
of O O 
the O O

and O O 
CBS O O 
News’ O O 
“Face O O 
the O O

on O O 
Sunday O O 
that O O 
he O O 
would O O 
do O O 
"whatever O O 
it O O 
takes," O O 
including O O 
a O O 
filibuster, O O 
to O O 
block O O 
the O O 
confirmations O O 
of O O 
Mike O O

to O O 
head O O 
the O O 
State O O

to O O 
run O O

740235127
“I O O 
frankly O O 
think O O 
that O O 
Pompeo’s O O 
positions O O 
are O O 
too O O 
much O O 
of O O 
an O O 
advocate O O 
for O O

right, O O 
too. O Thought-terminating_Cliches

advocated O O 
for O O 
regime O O 
change O O 
in O O

Korea. O O 

740235127
We've O O 
seen O O 
exactly O O 
what O O 
happens O O 
when O O 
the O O 
US O O 
gets O O 
involved O O 
in O O 
such O O 
types O O 
of O O 
regime O O 
changes, O O 
and O O 
the O O 
truth O O 
is O O 
that O O 
they O O 
really O O 
don't O O 
work O O 
out O O 
too O O 
well. O O 

740235127
As O O 
for O O 
Haspel, O O 
Paul O O 
told O O 
"Face O O 
The O O 
Nation," O O 
"She O O 
oversaw O O 
an O O 
illegal O O

ops O O 
operation O O 
in O O

that O O 
included O O 
torture. O O 

740235127
On O O 
"State O O 
of O O 
the O O

Paul O O 
added, O O 
"I'll O O 
do O O 
whatever O O 
it O O 
takes, O O 
and O O 
that O O 
includes O O 
filibuster" O O 
to O O 
block O O 
their O O 
confirmation. O O 

740235127
"I O O 
don't O O 
have O O 
the O O 
power O O 
to O O 
stop O O 
her O O 
nomination," O O 
he O O 
said O O 
of O O 
Haspel. O O 

740235127
"There's O O 
enough O O 
votes O O 
she'll O O 
eventually O O 
win. O O 

740235127
"On O O 
what O O 
level O O 
could O O 
torture O O 
ever O O 
be O O 
acceptable? O O 

740235127
Instead, O O 
people O O 
are O O 
acting O O 
out O O 
of O O 
emotion O O 
and O O 
fear. O O 

740235127
Do O O 
I O O 
believe O O 
we O O 
should O O 
be O O 
concerned O O 
about O O 
North O O 
Korea? O O 

740235127
Sure, O O 
but O O 
I'm O O 
hardly O O 
worried O O 
that O O 
they O O 
will O O 
actually O O 
attack O O 
us. O O 

740235127
Am O O 
I O O 
concerned O O 
about O O 
jihadis? O O 

740235127
Yep, O O 
but O O 
I'm O O 
not O O 
sure O O 
I've O O 
seen O O 
any O O 
real O O 
hard O O 
evidence O O 
that O O 
torturing O Loaded_Language

followed O O 
a O O

hearing O O 
held O O 
Wednesday O O 
in O O 
Washington, O O 
where O O 
lawyers O O 
for O O

and O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House O O 
faced O O 
off O O 
over O O 
the O O 
issue O O 
of O O

access. O O 

999001323
CNN O O 
had O O 
the O O 
broad O O 
support O O 
of O O 
other O O 
news O O 
organizations O O 
that O O 
believed O O 
the O O

“We O O

a O O 
CNN O O 
representative O O 
said O O 
in O O 
a O O 
statement. O O 

999001323
The O O 
White O O 
House O O 
said O O 
it O O 
would O O 
abide O O 
by O O 
Kelly’s O O 
ruling. O O 

999001323
“Today, O O 
the O O

In O O

999001323
At O O 
one O O 
point, O O

refused O O 
to O O

the O O 
microphone O O 
to O O 
a O O 
White O O 
House O O

who O O

retrieve O O 
it O O 
from O O 
him. O O 

999001323
CNN’s O O 
suit O O 
filed O O 
Tuesday O O 
says O O 
the O O 
suspension O O 
of O O 
Acosta’s O O 
credential O O 
violates O O 
the O O 
First O O 
Amendment’s O O 
protection O O

999001323
It O O 
also O O 
says O O 
the O O 
way O O 
the O O

revoked O O

with O O 
no O O

notice O O 
to O O

or O O 
a O O

999001323
Responding O O 
to O O 
the O O 
CNN O O 
suit, O O 
lawyers O O 
for O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House O O 
said O O 
the O O 
Trump O O 
administration O O 
had O O 
broad O O 
discretion O O 
to O O 
regulate O O 
access O O 
to O O 
journalists O O 
and O O 
other O O 
members O O 
of O O 
the O O 
public. O O 

999001323
“If O O 
the O O

wants O O 
to O O 
exclude O O 
all O O

grounds, O O 
he O Appeal_to_Authority

do O O 
that,” O O 
Deputy O O 
Assistant O O 
Attorney O O 
General O O 
James O O

said O O 
during O O 
the O O 
hearing. O O

“There’s O O 
no O O

Mark O O

of O O 
The O O 
Lawrence O O 
Herbert O O 
School O O

at O O 
Hofstra O O

and O O 
a O O 
former O O 
network O O 
news O O 
executive, O O 
praised O O 
the O O 
judge’s O O 
decision, O O 
which O O 
he O O 
said O O 
was O O 
not O O 
a O O 
surprise. O O 

999001323
“The O O 
White O O 
House O O 
has O O 
lots O O 
of O O 
other O O 
ways O O 
to O O 
deal O O 
with O O 
the O O 
behavior O O 
of O O 
reporters O O 
if O O 
that’s O O 
their O O 
concern, O O 
but O O 
closing O O 
the O O 
gate O O 
to O O 
a O O 
news O O 
organization O O 
is O O 
not O O 
one O O 
of O O 
these O O 
ways, O O 
and O O 
it’s O O 
important O O 
that O O 
the O O 
court O O 
stood O O 
up O O 
and O O 
said O O 
that,” O O 
Lukasiewicz O O 
said. O O 

999001323
“It’s O O 
not O O 
the O O 
first O O 
time O O 
a O O 
reporter O O 
has O O 
behaved O O 
in O O 
a O O 
way O O 
that O O 
a O O 
president O O 
doesn’t O O 
like.” O O 

999001323
Lukasiewicz O O 
believed O O 
CNN O O 
would O O 
reach O O 
a O O 
compromise O O 
with O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House O O 
rather O O 
than O O 
engage O O 
in O O 
a O O 
prolonged O O 
court O O 
battle. O O 

999001323
“The O O 
law O O 
and O O 
the O O 
Constitution O O 
is O O 
very O O 
clear O O 
here,” O O 
he O O 
said. O O 

999001323
CNN’s O O 
suit O O 
received O O 
the O O 
support O O 
of O O 
more O O 
than O O 
a O O 
dozen O O 
news O O 
organizations O O 
including O O 
Fox O O

where O O 
commentators O O 
have O O 
often O O 
echoed O O 
Trump’s O O 
criticisms O O 
of O O 
the O O 
network’s O O 
coverage. O O 

999001323
Rival O O

came O O 
to O O 
the O O 
defense O O 
of O O

in O O 
2009 O O 
when O O 
the O O

attempted O O 
to O O 
exclude O O 
its O O

from O O 
interviews O O 
with O O

head-on, O O

Notice O O

Geert O O 
Wilders O O 
spoke O O 
at O O 
a O O 
massive O O 
rally O O 
for O O 
Tommy O O

on O O 
Saturday. O O 

763280007
20,000 O O 
people O O 
came O O 
out O O 
to O O 
call O O 
for O O 
Tommy’s O O 
release, O O 
and O O

took O O 
the O O 
opportunity O O 
to O O 
put O O

of O O

notice. O O 

763280007
With O O 
Islamization. O O 

763280007
With O O 
open O O 
borders. O O 

763280007
We O O 
are O O 
almost O O 
foreigners O O 
in O O 
our O O 
own O O 
lands. O O 

763280007
And O O 
what O O 
do O O 
you O O 
say? O O 

763280007
And O O 
that’s O O 
right: O O 
enough O Slogans 
is O Slogans 
enough. O Slogans 

763280007
We O O 
will O O 
not O O 
be O O 
gagged O O 
anymore. O O 

763280007
It O O 
was O O 
extraordinary O O 
that O O 
the O O 
British O O 
authorities O O 
allowed O O 
Wilders O O 
into O O 
the O O 
country O O 
at O O 
all. O O 

763280007
Even O O 
worse, O O 
the O O 
bannings O O 
of O O 
Sellner, O O 
Pettibone, O O 
Southern, O O 
and O O 
Bachmann O O 
were O O 
just O O 
part O O 
of O O 
a O O 
long O O 
pattern. O O 

763280007
The O O 
UK O O 
Home O O 
Office O O 
also O O 
admitted O O 
Shaykh O O 
Hamza O O 
Sodagar O O 
into O O 
the O O 
country, O O 
despite O O 
the O O 
fact O O 
that O O 
he O O 
has O O 
said: O O 
“If O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
there’s O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
homosexual O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
men, O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
the O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
punishment O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
is O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
one O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
of O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
five O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
things. O Black-and-White_Fallacy 

763280007
One O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
– O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
the O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
easiest O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
one O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
maybe O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
– O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
chop O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
their O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
head O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
off, O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
that’s O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
the O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
easiest. O Black-and-White_Fallacy 

763280007
Second O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
– O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
burn O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
them O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
to O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
death. O Black-and-White_Fallacy 

763280007
Third O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
– O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
throw O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
’em O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
off O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
a O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
cliff. O Black-and-White_Fallacy 

763280007
Fourth O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
– O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
tear O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
down O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
a O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
wall O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
on O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
them O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
so O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
they O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
die O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
under O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
that. O Black-and-White_Fallacy 

763280007
Fifth O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
– O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
a O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
combination O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
of O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
the O Black-and-White_Fallacy 
above.” O Black-and-White_Fallacy 

763280007
One O O 
of O O 
them O O 
was O O 
welcomed O O 
by O O 
the O O 
Archbishop O O 
of O O 
Canterbury. O O 

763280007
Meanwhile, O O 
the O O 
UK O O 
banned O O 
three O O 
bishops O O 
from O O 
areas O O 
of O O 
Iraq O O 
and O O 
Syria O O 
where O O 
Christians O O 
are O O 
persecuted O O 
from O O 
entering O O 
the O O 
country. O O 

763280007
But O O 
now O O 
matters O O 
are O O 
coming O O 
to O O 
a O O 
head. O O 

763280007
Apparently O O 
British O O 
authorities O O 
decided O O 
that O O 
it O O 
would O O 
be O O 
too O O 
politically O O 
costly O O 
for O O 
them O O 
to O O 
bar O O 
Wilders O O 
again. O O 

763280007
The O O 
British O O 
government, O O 
in O O 
imprisoning O O 
Tommy O O 
Robinson, O O 
has O O 
shown O O 
itself O O 
willing O O 
to O O 
incarcerate O O 
people O O 
for O O 
having O O 
opinions O O 
that O O 
it O O 
considers O O 
unacceptable. O O 

763280007
Wilders O O 
added: O O 
“And O O 
I O O 
tell O O 
you, O O 
to O O 
the O O 
governments. O O 

763280007
You O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
can O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
throw O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
us O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
in O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
jail, O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
but O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
you O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
will O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
never O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
defeat O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 
us. O Appeal_to_fear-prejudice 

763280007
Because, O O 
my O O 
friends, O O 
for O O 
every O O 
Tommy O O 
whom O O 
you O O 
imprison, O O 
thousands O Loaded_Language 
will O Loaded_Language 
rise O Loaded_Language 
up. O Loaded_Language

111111135
Louis O O

the O O 
84-year-old O O 
head O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Nation O O 
of O O 
Islam, O O 
has O O 
been O O 
back O O 
in O O 
the O O

after O O 
a O O 
previously O O 
unreleased O O

of O O 
him O O 
with O O

an O O 
anti-Semitic O O 
speech O O 
at O O 
his O O

last O O

111111135
The O O

which O O 
was O O

a O O

almost O O 
three O O

111111135
Mr. O O 
Farrakhan O O 
has O O 
denied O O 
that O O 
he O O

anti-Semitic O O 
and O O 
has O O 
even O O 
said O O 
that O O 
his O O

have O O 
been O O 
Jewish. O O 

111111135
Much O O 
of O O 
the O O 
recent O O

has O O 
been O O 
focused O O 
on O O

one O O 
of O O 
the O O

111111135
What O O 
is O O 
the O O 
Nation O O 
of O O 
Islam? O O 

111111135
The O O 
Nation O O 
of O O 
Islam O O 
is O O 
a O O 
political O O 
and O O 
religious O O 
movement O O 
that O O 
was O O 
started O O 
by O O 
W.D. O O 

111111135
Fard O O 
Muhammad O O 
in O O 
1931 O O 
and O O 
continued O O 
by O O 
Elijah O O 
Muhammad O O 
in O O 
1933. O O 

111111135
It O O 
first O O 
became O O 
prominent O O 
after O O 
a O O 
man O O 
named O O 
Malcolm O O 
Little O O 
joined O O 
the O O 
organization. O O 

111111135
Encouraged O O 
by O O 
Elijah O O 
Muhammad, O O 
he O O 
changed O O 
his O O 
last O O 
name O O 
to O O 
X O O 
and O O 
became O O 
a O O 
minister O O 
in O O 
the O O 
movement. O O 

111111135
Who O O 
is O O 
Louis O O 
Farrakhan? O O 

111111135
Born O O 
Louis O O 
Eugene O O 
Walcott O O 
in O O 
New O O 
York O O 
in O O 
1933, O O 
Mr. O O 
Farrakhan O O 
joined O O 
the O O 
Nation O O 
of O O 
Islam O O 
in O O 
the O O 
mid-1950s O O 
and O O 
rose O O 
quickly O O 
within O O 
the O O 
organization, O O 
becoming O O 
close O O 
to O O 
Malcolm O O 
X. O O 

111111135
After O O 
the O O 
assassination O O 
of O O 
Malcolm O O 
X O O 
in O O 
1965, O O 
he O O 
became O O 
one O O 
of O O 
the O O 
most O O 
powerful O O 
members O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Nation O O 
and O O 
its O O 
chief O O 
spokesman, O O 
the O O 
position O O 
that O O 
Malcolm O O 
X O O 
had O O 
held. O O 

111111135
The O O 
Nation O O 
of O O 
Islam O O 
had O O 
gained O O 
followers O O 
around O O 
the O O 
nation O O 
in O O 
the O O 
1940s O O 
and O O 
’50s O O 
by O O 
providing O O 
something O O 
of O O 
a O O 
religious O O 
answer O O 
to O O 
antiblack O O 
racism. O O 

111111135
That O O 
political O O 
position O O 
became O O 
a O O 
vehicle O O 
for O O 
Mr. O O 
Farrakhan O O 
to O O 
express O O 
his O O 
anti-Semitism. O O 

111111135
In O O 
1975, O O 
when O O 
Elijah O O 
Muhammad O O 
died, O O 
the O O 
Nation O O 
split O O 
into O O 
two O O 
factions. O O 

111111135
The O O 
faction O O 
reconstituted O O 
under O O 
Mr. O O 
Farrakhan O O 
in O O 
the O O 
late O O 
1970s O O 
retained O O 
the O O 
original O O 
name, O O 
though O O 
not O O 
the O O 
influence O O 
or O O 
support O O 
that O O 
it O O 
had O O 
when O O 
its O O 
leaders O O 
were O O 
Malcolm O O 
X, O O 
Muhammad O O 
Ali O O 
and O O 
Elijah O O 
Muhammad. O O 

111111135
Mr. O O 
Curtis O O 
said O O 
that O O 
today O O 
the O O 
membership O O 
could O O 
be O O 
in O O 
the O O 
thousands, O O 
and O O 
there O O 
could O O 
even O O 
be O O 
as O O 
many O O 
as O O 
10,000 O O 
followers. O O 

111111135
Mr. O O 
Farrakhan, O O 
whose O O 
name, O O 
the O O 
Anti-Defamation O O 
League O O 
wrote O O 
after O O 
the O O 
February O O 
event, O O 
is O O 
“virtually O O 
synonymous O O 
with O O 
anti-Semitism,” O O 
then O O 
drew O O 
national O O 
attention O O 
in O O 
1984, O O 
when O O 
he O O 
exhorted O O 
his O O 
followers O O 
to O O 
support O O 
Jesse O O 
Jackson’s O O 
bid O O 
for O O 
the O O 
Democratic O O 
presidential O O 
nomination. O O 

111111135
In O O 
a O O 
radio O O 
address, O O 
he O O 
urged O O 
listeners O O 
to O O 
“make O O 
an O O 
example” O O 
of O O 
a O O 
Washington O O 
Post O O 
reporter O O 
who O O 
had O O 
reported O O 
that O O 
Mr. O O 
Jackson O O 
had O O 
used O O 
anti-Semitic O O 
terms O O 
in O O 
private. O O 

111111135
Mr. O O 
Jackson O O 
repudiated O O 
Mr. O O 
Farrakhan, O O 
but O O 
the O O 
minister’s O O 
support O O 
proved O O 
troublesome O O 
to O O 
his O O 
1988 O O 
campaign O O 
as O O 
well. O O 

111111135
He O O 
was O O 
back O O 
in O O 
the O O 
news O O 
in O O 
1995 O O 
when O O 
he O O 
organized O O 
what O O 
became O O 
known O O 
as O O 
the O O 
“Million O O 
Man O O 
March,” O O 
a O O 
political O O 
and O O 
religious O O 
revival O O 
event O O 
in O O 
Washington. O O 

111111135
On O O 
March O O 
3, O O 
she O O 
said O O 
on O O 
Twitter O O 
that O O 
someone O O 
had O O 
brought O O 
to O O 
her O O 
attention O O 
that O O 
she O O 
had O O 
yet O O 
to O O 
tweet O O 
“my O O 
absolute O Exaggeration,Minimisation 
position O Exaggeration,Minimisation 
on O O 
how O O 
wrong O O 
anti-Semitism O O 
is.” O O 
A O O 
day O O 
later, O O 
she O O 
said O O 
that O O 
she O O 
was O O 
“committed O O 
to O O 
ending O O 
anti-black O O 
racism, O O 
anti-Semitism, O O 
homophobia O O 
& O O 
transphobia,” O O 
but O O 
did O O 
not O O 
mention O O 
Mr. O O 
Farrakhan. O O 

111111135
In O O 
an O O 
essay O O 
posted O O 
Wednesday, O O 
she O O 
said O O 
that O O 
she O O 
had O O 
been O O 
attending O O 
Saviour’s O O 
Day O O 
celebrations O O 
for O O 
over O O 
30 O O 
years. O O 

111111135
“In O O 
that O O 
most O O 
difficult O O 
period O O 
of O O 
my O O

it O O

she O O 
said. O O 

111111135
The O O 
essay O O 
did O O 
not O O 
mention O O 
Mr. O O 
Farrakhan. O O 

111111135
Asked O O 
what O O 
the O O 
appeal O O 
of O O 
Mr. O O 
Farrakhan’s O O 
views O O 
might O O 
be O O 
to O O 
people O O 
like O O 
Ms. O O 
Mallory, O O 
religious O O 
scholars O O 
emphasized O O 
that O O 
the O O 
Nation O O 
of O O 
Islam O O 
is O O 
a O O 
religion O O 
and O O 
can O O 
provide O O 
comfort O O 
and O O 
aid O O 
to O O 
its O O 
adherents. O O 

111111135
“For O O

The O O 
department O O 
then O O 
went O O 
on O O 
to O O 
note O O 
that O O 
Guyger O O 
could O O 
appeal O O 
this O O 
firing O O 
under O O 
their O O 
civil O O 
service O O 
rules. O O 

789753303
Officer O O 
Guyger O O 
was O O 
terminated O O 
for O O 
her O O 
actions. O O 

789753303
She O O 
was O O 
hired O O 
in O O 
November O O 
2013 O O 
and O O 
was O O 
assigned O O 
to O O 
the O O 
Southeast O O 
Patrol O O 
Division. O O 

789753303
Under O O 
civil O O 
service O O 
rules, O O 
Officer O O 
Guyger O O 
has O O 
the O O 
right O O 
to O O 
appeal O O 
her O O 
discipline. O O 

789753303
This O O 
move O O 
is O O 
noteworthy O O 
as O O 
the O O 
department O O 
has O O 
been O O 
standing O O 
up O O 
against O O 
those O O 
who O O 
have O O 
been O O 
calling O O 
for O O 
the O O 
officer O O 
to O O 
be O O 
fired. O O 

789753303
As O O 
recently O O 
as O O 
Friday, O O 
Hall O O 
refused O O 
to O O 
fire O O 
Guyger, O O 
saying O O 
in O O 
part, O O 
“There O O 
is O O 
one O O 
overriding O O 
reason O O 
that O O 
I O O 
have O O 
not O O 
taken O O 
any O O 
administrative O O 
or O O 
employment O O 
action O O 
against O O 
Officer O O 
Amber O O 
Guyger. O O 

789753303
I O O 
don’t O O 
want O O 
to O O 
interfere O O 
with O O 
the O O 
on-going O O 
criminal O O 
investigation O O 
into O O 
her O O 
actions.” O O 

789753303
Also, O O 
in O O 
a O O 
town O O 
hall O O 
meeting O O 
last O O 
week, O O 
Hall O O 
again O O 
stood O O 
behind O O 
her O O 
choice O O 
to O O 
refuse O O 
to O O 
fire O O 
Guyger, O O 
claiming O O 
it O O 
would O O 
be O O 
against O O 
the O O 
law. O O 

789753303
“I O O 
can’t O O 
do O O 
that O O 
because O O 
there O O 
are O O 
both O O 
local, O O 
state O O 
and O O 
federal O O 
laws O O 
that O O 
prohibit O O 
me O O 
from O O 
taking O O 
action. O O 

789753303
There O O 
are O O 
civil O O 
service O O 
laws O O 
we O O 
have O O 
to O O 
adhere O O 
to,” O O 
said O O 
Hall. O O 

789753303
Apparently, O O 
it O O 
is O O 
no O O 
longer O O 
against O O 
the O O 
law. O O 

789753303
This O O 
news O O 
will O O 
likely O O 
be O O 
well O O 
received O O 
by O O 
the O O 
Jean O O 
family O O 
as O O 
well O O 
as O O 
the O O 
activists O O 
who O O 
have O O 
been O O 
calling O O 
for O O 
justice O O 
for O O 
Botham O O 
since O O 
the O O 
beginning. O O 

789753303
While O O 
controversy O O 
swarms O Loaded_Language 
the O O 
case O O 
of O O 
why O O 
she O O 
may O O 
have O O 
killed O O 
Jean, O O 
there O O 
is O O 
no O O 
doubt O O 
that O O 
she O O 
did O O 
kill O O 
him. O O 

789753303
This O O 
is O O 
a O O 
fact. O O 

789753303
Because O O 
of O O 
her O O 
actions, O O 
this O O 
man O O 
no O O 
longer O O 
lives. O O 

789753303
This O O 
alone O O 
should O O 
have O O 
been O O 
enough O O 
to O O 
fire O O 
her. O O 

789753303
Surprisingly O O 
enough, O O 
NRA O O 
spokesperson O O 
Dana O O 
Loesch O O 
responded O O 
to O O 
the O O 
firing O O 
of O O 
Guyger O O 
with O O 
one O O 
word, O O 
“Good,” O O 
showing O O 
her O O 
support O O 
for O O 
the O O 
move. O O 

789753303
For O O 
those O O 
who O O 
don’t O O 
recall, O O 
Loesch O O 
sparked O O 
controversy O O 
earlier O O 
this O O 
month O O 
by O O 
claiming O O 
that O O 
if O O 
Botham O O 
Jean O O 
were O O 
a O O 
gun O O 
owner, O O 
he O O 
may O O 
be O O 
alive O O 
today. O O 

789753303
Indeed, O O 
as O O 
TFTP O O 
reported O O 
over O O 
the O O 
weekend, O O 
a O O 
father O O 
in O O 
Prince O O 
George’s O O 
County O O 
opened O O 
fire O O 
on O O 
officers O O 
as O O 
they O O 
wrongly O O 
entered O O 
his O O 
apartment. O O 

789753303
He O O 
shot O O 
two O O 
officers. O O 

789753303
Not O O 
only O O 
was O O 
he O O 
not O O 
arrested, O O 
but O O 
the O O 
police O O 
chief O O 
praised O O 
him O O 
and O O 
apologized. O O 

789753303
In O O 
response O O 
to O O 
Guyger’s O O 
termination, O O 
the O O 
family’s O O 
attorney, O O 
Lee O O 
Merritt O O 
noted O O 
that O O 
the O O 
family O O 
expressed O O 
“satisfaction” O O 
with O O 
the O O 
move. O O 

789753303
“The O O 
Jean O O 
family O O 
expressed O O 
satisfaction O O 
in O O 
this O O 
explanation O O 
and O O 
in O O 
Guyger’s O O 
termination. O O 

789753303
We O O 
see O O 
it O O 
as O O 
an O O 
initial O O 
victory O O 
— O O 
well O O 
received O O 
on O O 
the O O 
day O O 
Botham O O 
Jean O O 
is O O 
laid O O 
to O O 
rest O O 
in O O 
his O O 
native O O 
country O O 
in O O 
St. O O

Merritt’s O O 
office O O 
said O O 
in O O 
a O O 
statement, O O 
adding O O 
that O O 
they O O 
are O O 
committed O O 
to O O 
see O O 
a O O 
“proper O O

and O O

during O O

772836731
I O O 
was O O 
working O O

the O O

from O O

772836731
Republican O O 
Senators O O 
Hatch, O O 
Roth, O O 
and O O 
Hayakawa O O 
were O O 
trying O O 
to O O 
introduce O O 
a O O 
supply-side O O 
economic O O 
policy O O 
as O O 
a O O 
cure O O 
for O O 
the O O 
stagflation O O 
that O O 
was O O 
threatening O O 
the O O

772836731
The O O 
Democrats, O O 
who O O 
later O O 
in O O 
the O O 
Senate O O 
led O O 
the O O 
way O O 
to O O 
a O O 
supply-side O O 
policy, O O 
were, O O 
at O O 
this O O 
time, O O 
opposed O O 
(see O O

Revolution, O O

772836731
The O O 
Democrats O O 
claimed O O 
that O O 
the O O 
policy O O 
would O O 
worsen O O 
the O O 
budget O O 
deficit, O O 
the O O 
only O O 
time O O 
in O O 
those O O 
days O O 
Democrats O O 
cared O O 
about O O 
the O O 
budget O O 
deficit. O O 

772836731
The O O 
Democrats O O 
said O O 
that O O 
they O O 
would O O 
support O O 
the O O 
tax O O 
rate O O 
reductions O O 
if O O 
the O O 
Republicans O O 
would O O 
support O O 
offsetting O O

in O O 
the O O 
budget O O 
to O O 
support O O 
a O O

budget. O O 

772836731
This O O 
was O O 
a O O

to O O 
put O O

for O O 
taking O O

in O O 
order O O 
“to O O

for O O

772836731
The O O 
supply-side O O 
policy O O 
did O O 
not O O 
require O O 
budget O O 
cuts, O O 
but O O 
in O O 
order O O 
to O O 
demonstrate O O 
the O O 
Democrats O O 
lack O O 
of O O 
sincerety, O O 
Hayakawa’s O O 
aid O O 
and O O 
I O O 
had O O 
our O O 
senators O O 
introduce O O 
a O O 
series O O 
of O O 
budget O O 
cuts O O 
together O O 
with O O

that, O O 
on O O 
a O O

(not O O

kept O O 
the O O

voted O O

every O O

from O O 
an O O 
article O O 
in O O 
which O O 
Tweeden O O 
shared O O 
her O O 
story… O O 

707772906
I O O 
couldn’t O O 
believe O O 
it. O O 

707772906
He O O 
groped O O 
me, O O 
without O O 
my O O 
consent, O O 
while O O 
I O O 
was O O 
asleep. O O 

707772906
How O O 
dare O Loaded_Language 
anyone O Loaded_Language 
grab O O 
my O O

like O O 
this O O 
and O O 
think O O 
it’s O O 
funny? O O 

707772906
I O O 
told O O 
my O O 
husband O O 
everything O O 
that O O 
happened O O 
and O O 
showed O O 
him O O 
the O O 
picture. O O 

707772906
But O O 
that O O 
was O O 
then, O O 
this O O 
is O O 
now. O O 

707772906
When O O 
the O O 
story O O 
initially O O 
broke, O O 
Franken O O 
rushed O O 
to O O 
issue O O 
an O O 
apology… O O 

707772906
“I O O 
certainly O O 
don’t O O 
remember O O 
the O O

but O O 
I O O 
send O O

sincerest O O 
apologies O O

said O O 
Franken. O O 

707772906
“As O O 
to O O 
the O O 
photo, O O 
it O O 
was O O 
clearly O O 
intended O O 
to O O 
be O O 
funny O O 
but O O 
wasn’t. O O

shouldn’t O O 
have O O 
done O O 
it.” O O

and O O 
now O O 
the O O

voiced O O 
his O O 
frustration O O

the O O 
inadequacy O O 
of O O

apology O O 
on O O 
Twitter. O O 

707772906
“That O O 
was O O 
not O O 
an O O 
apology O O

was O O 
an O O 
insufficient O O

serious O O

tweeted. O O 

707772906
And O O 
of O O 
course, O O 
since O O 
we O O

707772906

ever O O 
entered O O

and O O 
we O O

that. O O 

707772906
But O O 
just O O 
because O O 
he O O 
was O O 
a O O

does O O 
not O O 
mean O O 
that O O 
he O O 
gets O O

at O O 
the O O 
time O O 
a O O

“’I O O

On O O

change O O 
in O O

it O O 
struck O O 
with O O 
his O O

didn’t O O 
announce O O 
a O O 
new O O 
strategy O O 
for O O 
preventing O O

or O O 
limiting O O

699142854
Trump’s O O 
move O O 
was O O 
not O O 
operational. O O 

699142854
It O O 
was O O 
directional. O O 

699142854
In O O 
his O O 
address O O 
Friday, O O 
Trump O O 
changed O O 
the O O 
policy O O 
dynamics O O 
that O O 
dictate O O 
US O O 
policy O O 
on O O 
Iran. O O 

699142854
Trump’s O O 
dossier O O 
was O O 
interlaced O O 
with O O 
condemnations O O 
of O O 
the O O 
regime’s O O 
repression O O 
of O O 
its O O 
own O O 
people. O O 

699142854
It O O 
is O O 
notable O O 
that O O 
these O O 
remarks O O 
preceded O O 
Trump’s O O 
discussion O O 
of O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
deal O O 
– O O 
which O O 
was O O 
the O O 
ostensible O O 
subject O O 
of O O 
his O O 
speech. O O 

699142854
This O O 
was O O 
a O O 
critical O O 
point O O 
because O O 
for O O 
the O O 
past O O 
two O O 
years, O O 
US O O 
discourse O O 
on O O 
Iran O O 
has O O 
focused O O 
solely O O 
on O O 
whether O O 
or O O 
not O O 
Iran O O 
was O O 
complying O O 
with O O 
Obama’s O O 
nuclear O O 
pact. O O 

699142854
After O O 
accomplishing O O 
that O O 
goal, O O 
Trump O O 
turned O O 
his O O 
attention O O 
to O O 
how O O 
Iran O O 
is O O 
actually O O 
breaching O O 
the O O 
letter O O 
and O O 
spirit O O 
of O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
pact. O O 

699142854
By O O 
empowering O O 
Congress O O 
to O O 
prohibit O O 
economic O O 
cooperation O O 
with O O 
Iran, O O 
Trump O O 
put O O 
the O O 
Europeans, O O 
Chinese O O 
and O O 
Russians O O 
on O O 
notice O O 
that O O 
they O O 
may O O 
soon O O 
face O O 
a O O 
choice O O 
between O O 
conducting O O 
business O O 
with O O 
the O O 
US O O 
and O O 
conducting O O 
business O O 
with O O 
Iran. O O 

699142854
Among O O 
other O O 
things, O O 
he O O 
suggested O O 
expanding O O 
the O O 
inspection O O 
regime O O 
against O O 
Iran’s O O 
nuclear O O 
installations O O 
and O O 
canceling O O 
the O O 
so-called O O 
“sunset” O O 
clause O O 
that O O 
places O O 
an O O 
end O O 
date O O 
on O O 
the O O 
restrictions O O 
governing O O 
certain O O 
components O O 
of O O 
Iran’s O O 
nuclear O O 
advancement. O O 

699142854
Trump’s O O 
address O O 
has O O 
the O O 
potential O O 
to O O 
serve O O 
as O O 
the O O 
foundation O O 
of O O 
a O O 
major, O O 
positive O O 
shift O O 
in O O 
US O O 
policy O O 
toward O O 
Iran. O O 

699142854
Such O O 
a O O 
shift O O 
could O O 
potentially O O 
facilitate O O 
the O O 
achievement O O 
of O O 
Trump’s O O 
goals O O 
of O O 
preventing O O 
Iran O O 
from O O 
acquiring O O 
nuclear O O 
weapons, O O 
containing O O 
its O O 
regional O O 
aggression O O 
and O O 
empowerment O O 
and O O 
defeating O O 
its O O 
terrorist O O 
proxies. O O 

699142854
Trump’s O O 
decision O O 
to O O 
transfer O O 
immediate O O 
responsibility O O 
to O O 
Congress O O 
for O O 
holding O O 
Iran O O 
accountable O O 
for O O 
its O O 
hostile O O 
actions O O 
on O O 
the O O 
military O O 
and O O 
other O O 
fronts O O 
is O O 
a O O 
risky O O 
move. O O 

699142854
He O O 
has O O 
a O O 
lot O O 
of O O 
enemies, O O 
and O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
deal O O 
has O O 
a O O 
lot O O 
of O O 
supporters O O 
on O O 
Capitol O O 
Hill. O O 

699142854
Obama O O 
would O O 
have O O 
never O O 
been O O 
able O O 
to O O 
implement O O 
his O O 
nuclear O O 
deal O O 
if O O 
Senator O O 
Bob O O 
Corker, O O 
chairman O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Senate O O 
Foreign O O 
Affairs O O 
Committee, O O 
hadn’t O O 
agreed O O 
to O O 
cast O O 
the O O 
Constitution O O 
aside O O 
and O O 
ignore O O 
Obama’s O O 
constitutional O O 
duty O O 
to O O 
present O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
deal O O 
to O O 
the O O 
Senate O O 
for O O 
ratification O O 
as O O 
a O O 
treaty. O O 

699142854
Today O O 
Corker O O 
has O O 
nothing O O 
to O O 
restrain O O 
him O O 
from O O 
scuttling O O 
Trump’s O O 
agenda. O O 

699142854
If O O 
he O O 
wishes, O O 
out O O 
of O O 
spite, O O 
Corker O O 
can O O 
block O O 
effective O O 
sanctions O O 
from O O 
being O O 
passed. O O 

699142854
And O O 
he O O 
may O O 
do O O 
so O O 
even O O 
though O O 
the O O 
implications O O 
for O O 
his O O 
Senate O O 
colleagues O O 
would O O 
be O O 
dire O Loaded_Language 
and O Loaded_Language 
even O O 
though O O 
doing O O 
so O O 
would O O 
render O O 
him O O 
an O O 
unofficial O O 
protector O O 
of O O 
Iran’s O O 
nuclear O O 
program. O O 

699142854
Leading O O 
Democratic O O 
senators O O 
like O O 
Robert O O 
Menendez, O O 
Ben O O 
Cardin O O 
and O O 
Chuck O O 
Schumer, O O 
who O O 
opposed O O 
Obama’s O O 
Iran O O 
deal O O 
may O O 
now O O 
feel O O 
that O O 
as O O 
opponents O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Trump O Repetition 
administration, O O 
they O O 
are O O 
required O O 
to O O 
oppose O O 
any O O 
change O O 
to O O 
the O O 
Iran O O 
Nuclear O O 
Agreement O O 
Review O O 
Act. O O 

699142854
Indeed, O O 
given O O 
the O O 
rise O O 
of O O 
radical O O 
forces O O 
in O O 
their O O 
party O O 
it O O 
is O O 
likely O O 
that O O 
they O O 
would O O 
rather O O 
give O O 
Iran O O 
a O O 
free O O 
pass O O 
for O O 
its O O 
anti-American O O 
aggression O O 
and O O 
nuclear O O 
proliferation O O 
than O O 
work O O 
with O O 
Republicans O O 
on O O 
Capitol O O 
Hill O O 
and O O 
in O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House. O O 

699142854
Then O O 
again, O O 
by O O 
framing O O 
the O O 
issue O O 
of O O 
Iran’s O O 
threat O O 
to O O 
America O O 
as O O 
he O O 
did, O O 
and O O 
by O O 
transferring O O 
responsibility O O 
for O O 
reinstating O O 
sanctions O O 
and O O 
passing O O 
further O O 
sanctions O O 
on O O 
Iran O O 
to O O 
Congress, O O 
Trump O O 
opened O O 
up O O 
the O O 
possibility O O 
that O O 
Congress O O 
will O O 
conduct O O 
substantive O O 
– O O 
rather O O 
than O O 
personal O O 
– O O 
debates O O 
on O O 
Iran. O O 

699142854
And O O 
the O O 
more O O 
substantive O O 
those O O 
debates O O 
become, O O 
the O O 
further O O 
away O O 
the O O 
US O O 
discourse O O 
will O O 
move O O 
from O O 
the O O 
mendacious O Loaded_Language 
assumptions O Loaded_Language 
of O O 
Obama’s O O 
Iran O O 
policy O O 
– O O 
that O O 
the O O 
Iranian O O 
regime O O 
is O O 
a O O 
responsible O O 
actor O O 
and O O 
potential O O 
US O O 
ally, O O 
and O O 
that O O 
there O O 
is O O 
nothing O O 
inherently O O 
aggressive O Loaded_Language 
or O O 
problematic O O 
about O O 
Iran’s O O 
illicit O O 
nuclear O O 
weapons O O 
program. O O 

699142854
The O O 
second O O 
major O O 
risk O O 
inherent O O 
in O O 
Trump’s O O 
approach O O 
is O O 
that O O 
he O O 
will O O 
get O O 
his O O 
way; O O 
that O O 
the O O 
Europeans, O O 
Russians O O 
and O O 
Chinese O O 
and O O 
the O O 
Iranians O O 
will O O 
agree O O 
to O O 
improve O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
deal. O O 

699142854
The O O 
problem O O 
here O O 
is O O 
not O O 
obvious. O O 

699142854
Clearly, O O 
it O O 
is O O 
better O O 
if O O 
the O O 
deal O O 
is O O 
amended O O 
to O O 
delete O O 
the O O 
sunset O O 
clauses O O 
and O O 
expand O O 
the O O 
inspections O O 
regime. O O 

699142854
Yet O O 
even O O 
an O O 
amended, O O 
improved O O 
deal O O 
will O O 
still O O 
serve O O 
as O O 
a O O 
shield O O 
to O O 
Iran’s O O 
nuclear O O 
program. O O 

699142854
So O O 
long O O 
as O O 
the O O 
US O O 
continues O O 
to O O 
maintain O O 
a O O 
policy O O 
based O O 
on O O 
the O O 
false O O 
view O O 
that O O 
all O O 
that O O 
is O O 
necessary O O 
to O O 
destroy O O 
the O O 
threat O O 
of O O 
a O O 
nuclear O O 
armed O O 
Iran O O 
is O O 
a O O 
combination O O 
of O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
deal O O 
and O O 
economic O O 
sanctions, O O 
it O O 
will O O 
continue O O 
to O O 
ensure O O 
that O O 
Iran O O 
and O O 
its O O 
nuclear O O 
program O O 
remain O O 
a O O 
major O O 
threat. O O 

699142854
To O O 
understand O O 
what O O 
must O O 
be O O 
done O O 
we O O 
must O O 
return O O 
to O O 
Trump’s O O 
speech O O 
and O O 
its O O 
strategic O O 
significance. O O 

699142854
By O O 
taking O O 
a O O 
holistic O O 
view O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Iranian O O 
threat O O 
– O O 
grounded O O 
in O O 
a O O 
recognition O O 
of O O 
the O O 
inherent O O 
hostility O O 
of O O 
the O O 
regime O O 
– O O 
Trump O O 
opened O O 
up O O 
the O O 
possibility O O 
that O O 
the O O 
US O O 
and O O 
its O O 
allies O O 
can O O 
develop O O 
a O O 
holistic O O 
policy O O 
for O O 
confronting O O 
and O O 
defeating O O 
Iran O O 
and O O 
its O O 
proxies. O O 

699142854
If O O 
the O O 
Iran O O 
deal O O 
and O O 
sanctions O O 
are O O 
two O O 
components O O 
to O O 
a O O 
larger O O 
strategy O O 
rather O O 
than O O 
the O O 
entire O O 
strategy, O O 
they O O 
can O O 
be O O 
helpful. O O 

699142854
A O O 
wider O O 
strategy O O 
would O O 
target O O 
Iran’s O O 
regional O O 
aggression O O 
by O O 
weakening O O 
its O O 
proxies O O 
and O O 
clients O O 
from O O 
Hezbollah O O 
and O O 
Hamas O O 
to O O 
the O O 
regimes O O 
in O O 
Iraq, O O 
Yemen, O O 
Syria O O 
and O O 
Lebanon. O O 

699142854
It O O 
would O O 
target O O 
the O O 
regime O O 
itself O O 
by O O 
empowering O O 
the O O 
ayatollahs’ O O 
domestic O O 
opponents. O O 

699142854
It O O 
would O O 
pin O O 
down O O 
Iranian O O 
forces O O 
by O O 
arming O O 
and O O 
otherwise O O 
assisting O O 
the O O 
Iraqi O O

to O O 
defend O O

maintain O O 
their O O 
control O O 
over O O

Plague O O

caused O O 
by O O 
infection O O 
with O O 
the O O

is O O

frequently O O 
carried O O 
by O O

698719689
The O O 
bacteria O O 
will O O 
eventually O O 
end O O 
up O O 
causing O O 
the O O 
often O O 
fatal O Loaded_Language 
plague. O O 

698719689
Symptoms O O 
can O O 
include O O 
painful, O O 
swollen O O 
lymph O O 
nodes, O O 
called O O 
buboes, O O 
as O O 
well O O 
as O O 
fever, O O 
chills, O O 
and O O 
coughing. O O 

698719689
Pneumonic O O 
plague O O 
is O O 
more O O 
virulent O O 
or O O 
damaging O O 
and O O 
is O O 
an O O 
advanced O O 
form O O 
of O O 
the O O 
disease O O 
characterized O O 
by O O 
a O O 
severe O Loaded_Language

infection. O O 

698719689
The O O 
infection O O 
can O O 
be O O 
transmitted O O 
from O O

via O O 
airborne O O

from O O

698719689
According O O

those O O 
that O O

698719689
And O O 
while O O 
the O O

with O O 
an O O

400 O O 
cases O O 
of O O

each O O 
year, O O 
this O O 
time O O 
things O O 
are O O 
very O O 
different, O O 
experts O O 
warn. O O 

698719689
This O O 
year, O O 
health O O 
officials O O 
report O O 
the O O 
infections O O 
started O O 
much O O 
earlier O O 
than O O 
usual, O O 
and O O 
they’re O O 
occurring O O 
in O O 
new O O 
areas, O O 
including O O 
urban O O 
settings. O O 

698719689
They’ve O O 
also O O 
seen O O 
an O O 
unexpected O O 
number O O 
of O O 
cases O O 
of O O 
pneumonic O O 
plague, O Repetition 
which O O 
transmits O O 
more O O 
easily O O 
from O O 
person O O 
to O O 
person. O O 

698719689
Early O O 
detection O O 
of O O 
the O O 
plague O O 
is O O 
key O O 
since O O 
both O O 
forms O O 
of O O 
it O O 
can O O 
be O O 
cured O O 
with O O 
antibiotics. O O 

698719689
But, O O 
occasionally O O 
there O O 
can O O 
be O O 
cases O O 
of O O 
septicemic O O 
plague, O O 
where O O 
the O O 
infection O O 
has O O 
spread O O 
to O O 
a O O 
person’s O O 
bloodstream O O 
and O O 
can O O 
cause O O 
bleeding O O 
and O O 
necrosis O O 
of O O 
tissue, O O 
turning O O 
it O O 
black. O O 

698719689

Obama O O

would O O

all O O 
that O O

is O O 
to O O 
return O O 
the O O

for O O 
review. O O 

698503276
Had O O

followed O O 
the O O 
Constitution O O 
and O O 
submitted O O 
the O O 
JCPOA O O 
to O O 
the O O 
Senate O O 
as O O 
a O O 
treaty O O 
in O O 
the O O

the O O 
JCPOA O O 
in O O 
its O O 
present O O 
form O O 
almost O O 
certainly O O 
would O O 
not O O 
have O O 
been O O 
approved. O O 

698503276
Congress O O 
should O O 
now O O 
have O O 
the O O 
opportunity O O 
to O O 
revisit O O 
the O O

to O O 
determine O O 
whether O O 
the O O

promised O O 
are O O

698503276
Congress O O 
should O O 
also O O 
consider O O 
whether O O

continue O O 
to O O 
make O O 
sense O O 
in O O

of O O 
what O O

are O O 
now O O 
experiencing O O 
with O O 
Iran’s O O 
nuclear O O

collaborator, O O 
North O O

698503276
It O O 
bought O O 
time O O 
to O O 
turn O O 
into O O

under O Loaded_Language 
our O O

698503276
Kerry O O 
had O O 
promised O O 
that O O 
the O O 
Iranian O O 
regime O O 
would O O 
be O O 
prohibited O O 
from O O 
testing O O 
ballistic O O 
missiles. O O 

698503276
This O O 
turned O O 
out O O 
to O O 
be O O 
a O O 
lie. O O 

698503276
After O O 
the O O 
JCPOA O O 
was O O 
finalized, O O 
with O O 
no O O 
such O O 
prohibition O O 
included, O O 
Iran O O 
continued O O 
to O O 
test O O 
such O O 
missiles. O O 

698503276
The O O 
Obama O O 
administration’s O O 
response O O 
was O O 
that O O 
the O O 
missiles O O 
had O O 
become O O 
a O O

issue, O O 
to O O

replaced O O

on O O

ballistic O O 
missile O O 
program O O 
with O O 
a O O 
weak O O 
declaration O O 
in O O 
an O O 
annex O O 
that O O 
simply O O 
“calls O O 
upon” O O 
Iran O O 
not O O 
to O O 
undertake O O 
any O O 
activity O O 
such O O 
as O O

and O O

the O O

In O O

aired O O 
on O O 
April O O

2015, O O 
that O O

“you O O

The O O 
JCPOA’s O O 
supporters, O O

have O O 
made O O 
much O O 
of O O 
the O O 
fact O O 
that O O 
the O O 
International O O 
Atomic O O

Agency O O 
(IAEA) O O 
has O O 
on O O 
several O O

verified O O 
Iran’s O O 
compliance O O 
with O O 
its O O 
commitments O O 
under O O

keeping O O

set O O

698503276
Iran O O

the O O 
limit O O 
on O O 
its O O

the O O 
IAEA’s O O 
satisfaction. O O 

698503276
IAEA O O 
chief O O 
Yukiya O O 
Amano O O 
reiterated O O 
in O O 
a O O 
statement O O 
he O O 
issued O O 
on O O 
October O O

that O O 
Iran O O

remained O O

compliance O O 
with O O 
its O O 
JCPOA O O 
commitments. O O 

698503276
The O O 
problem, O O 
as O O 
any O O 
clear-eyed O O 
observer O O 
of O O 
the O O 
process O O 
recognizes, O O 
is O O 
that O O 
the O O 
IAEA O O 
relies O O 
on O O 
Iran O O 
for O O 
self-inspection O O 
of O O 
certain O O 
sites O O 
that O O 
the O O

does O O 
not O O 
want O O 
the O O

to O O 
inspect O O 
freely O O 
on O O 
its O O 
own. O O 

698503276
IAEA O O

have O O 
avoided O O

698503276
The O O

explanation O O 
for O O 
not O O 
visiting O O 
any O O 
of O O

is O O

789512681
Prior O O 
to O O

Ellison's O O

called O O

to O O 
ensure O O 
that O O

789512681

789512681
She O O 
stood O O 
alongside O O 
other O O 
female O O 
survivors O O 
of O O 
abuse. O O 

789512681
Ellison O O 
not O O 
only O O 
claimed O O 
the O O 
women O O 
were O O 
lying O O 
but O O 
then O O 
fled O O 
the O O 
scene. O O 

789512681
At O O

he O O 
said O O 
something O O 
there, O O 
which O O

than O O

fled O O

hounding O Loaded_Language

questioning O O 
him O O 
about O O

asking O O 
him O O 
to O O 
respond O O

the O O

report, O O

789512681

789512681
This O O

“I O O

But O O 
that O O 
wasn’t O O 
it. O O 

789512681
Ellison O O 
first O O 
sought O O 
office O O 
as O O 
a O O 
Democrat O O 
in O O 
1998 O O 
as O O 
Keith O O 
Ellison-Muhammad, O O 
a O O 
self-avowed O O

of O O 
the O O

789512681

789512681
Fortunately O O 
for O O 
him, O O 
Ellison’s O O 
5th O O

haven’t O O 
much O O 
cared O O 
about O O

almost O O

exactly O O

wants O O 
it. O O 

789512681

determined O O

The O O 
four O O

who O O 
murdered O O

met O O 
and O O 
planned O O 
the O O 
murder O O 
at O O 
Willis’s O O 
house. O O 

789512681
Despite O O 
the O O 
fact O O 
that O O 
two O O 
witnesses O O 
implicated O O 
Willis O O 
in O O 
the O O 
planning O O 
he O O 
was O O 
never O O 
charged O O 
because O O 
law O O

authorities O O 
said O O 
they O O 
lacked O O 
sufficient O O 
evidence O O 
to O O 
convict O O 
him. O O 

789512681
At O O 
the O O 
time, O O 
Ellison O O 
was O O 
a O O 
Minneapolis O O 
attorney O O 
in O O 
private O O 
practice. O O 

789512681
And O O 
within O O 
a O O 
month O O 
of O O 
Haaf’s O O 
murder, O O 
Ellison O O 
appeared O O 
with O O 
Willis O O 
supporting O O 
the O O 
United O O 
for O O 
Peace O O 
gang O O 
front. O O 

789512681
In O O 
October O O 
1992, O O 
Ellison O O 
helped O O 
organize O O 
a O O 
demonstration O O 
against O O 
Minneapolis O O 
police O O 
that O O 
included O O 
United O O 
for O O

789512681
“The O O 
main O O 
point O O 
of O O 
our O O

is O O 
to O O 
support O O

the O O

has O O 
been O O 
waging,” O O 
said O O 
Ellison. O O 

789512681
Willis O O 
was O O 
the O O 
last O O 
speaker O O 
at O O 
the O O 
demonstration. O O 

789512681
According O O 
to O O 
a O O 
contemporaneous O O 
report O O 
in O O 
the O O 
St. O O 
Paul O O 
Pioneer O O 
Press, O O 
Willis O O 
told O O 
the O O 
crowd O O 
that O O 
Minneapolis O O 
police O O 
were O O 
experiencing O O 
the O O 
same O O 
fear O O 
from O O 
young O O 
black O O 
men O O 
that O O 
blacks O O 
had O O 
felt O O 
from O O 
police O O 
for O O 
many O O 
years. O O 

789512681
“If O O 
the O O 
police O O 
have O O 
some O O 
fear, O O 
I O O 
understand O O 
that O O 
fear,” O O 
Willis O O 
said. O O 

789512681
. O O 

789512681
[W]e’re O O 
going O O 
to O O 
get O O 
rid O O 
of O O 
them,” O O 
Willis O O 
said. O O 

789512681
That O O 
way, O O 
Ellison O O 
said, O O 
the O O 
union O O 
can O O 
increase O O 
its O O 
power O O 
base.” O O 
Ellison O O 
publicly O O 
supported O O 
the O O 
Haaf O O 
murder O O 
defendants. O O 

789512681
In O O 
February O O 
1993, O O 
he O O 
spoke O O 
at O O 
a O O 
demonstration O O 
for O O 
one O O 
of O O 
them O O 
during O O 
his O O 
trial. O O 

789512681
The O O 
Haaf O O 
case O O 
wasn’t O O 
an O O 
aberration O O 
for O O 
Ellison. O O 

789512681

Bryan O O

a O O

account O O 
of O O 
Chesimard’s O O 
terrorist O O 
career. O O 

789512681
In O O

the O O

$1,000,000 O O 
for O O 
her O O

789512681
Yet O O 
Ellison O O 
prayed O O 
for O O 
Chesimard O O 
in O O 
his O O 
National O O

speech: O O 
“I O O 
am O O 
praying O O 
that O O

not O O

he O O 
has O O 
to O O 
really O O 
barter O O

they’re O O

they’re O O 
going O O 
to O O 
get O O 
a O O 
whole O O

of O O 
other O O

he O O 
told O O 
the O O 
crowd. O O 

789512681
“I O O 
hope O O 
the O O

can O O 
stick O O

Ellison’s O O 
support O O 
for O O 
Soliah/Olson O O 
in O O 
the O O 
speech O O 
is O O 
equally O O 
notable. O O 

789512681
He O O 
denounced O O 
law O O 
enforcement O O 
authorities O O 
for O O 
prosecuting O O 
the O O 
attempted O O 
murder O O 
of O O 
police O O 
officers. O O 

789512681
He O O 
described O O 
her O O 
as O O 
one O O 
of O O 
those O O 
who O O 
had O O 
been O O 
“fighting O O 
for O O

in O O 
the O O 
‘60s O O

and O O 
called O O 
for O O 
her O O 
release. O O 

789512681
Ellison O O 
to O O 
the O O 
contrary O O 
notwithstanding, O O 
Soliah/Olson O O 
pleaded O O 
guilty O O 
to O O 
the O O 
crimes O O 
charged O O 
in O O 
Los O O

and O O 
to O O 
an O O 
additional O O

charge O O 
in O O 
Sacramento. O O 

789512681
According O O 
to O O

Soliah/Olson O O 
was O O 
a O Name_Calling,Labeling

But O O 
according O O 
to O O 
the O O 
Navy, O O 
the O O 
past O O 
five O O 
months O O 
have O O 
witnessed O O 
markedly O O 
less O O

conduct O O 
from O O 
the O O

leaving O O

baffled O O 
by O O 
the O O 
sudden O O 
positive O O 
change O O 
in O O 
attitude. O O 

727569885
In O O 
fact, O O 
Iran’s O O 
attitude O O 
adjustment O O 
in O O 
the O O 
Arabian O O 
Gulf O O 
is O O 
no O O 
mystery O O 
and O O 
stems O O 
from O O 
the O O 
Trump O O 
administration’s O O 
implementation O O 
of O O 
a O O 
new O O 
robust O O 
foreign O O 
policy O O 
vis-à-vis O O 
the O O 
Islamic O O 
Republic. O O 

727569885
Soon O O 
after O O 
taking O O 
office, O O 
Trump O O 
noted O O 
that O O 
“Iran O O 
[was] O O 
playing O Loaded_Language 
with O Loaded_Language 
fire” O Loaded_Language 
and O O 
added O O 
that O O 
he O O 
wouldn’t O O 
be O O 
as O O 
“kind” O O 
to O O 
the O O 
mullahs O O 
as O O 
Obama O O 
was. O O 

727569885
It O O 
was O O 
backed O O 
up O O 
by O O 
tangible O O 
action. O O 

727569885
Additional O O 
sanctions O O 
were O O 
imposed O O 
against O O 
Iran O O 
for O O 
acting O O 
in O O 
defiance O O 
of O O 
UNSCR O O 
2231. O O 

727569885
Sanctions O O 
were O O 
also O O 
imposed O O 
against O O 
the O O 
IRGC O O 
for O O 
supporting O O 
terrorism. O O 

727569885
Trump’s O O

revived O O

breathed O Loaded_Language

a O O 
promising O O

initiative O O 
shelved O O 
by O O

727569885
Most O O 
importantly, O O 
Trump O O 
failed O O 
to O O 
certify O O 
the O O 
JCPOA O O 
noting O O 
material O O 
Iranian O O 
breaches, O O 
and O O 
has O O 
threatened O O 
to O O 
abrogate O O 
the O O 
deal O O 
in O O 
its O O 
entirety O O 
unless O O 
modifications O O 
are O O 
implemented. O O 

727569885
Those O O

would O O 
include O O 
an O O

In O O

had O O 
stories O O 
of O O

707451080
CNN O O 
spoke O O 
with O O 
more O O

50 O O

current O O

former O O

the O O

anonymously O O 
to O O

and O O 
avoid O O 
potential O O

707451080
With O O

every O O

said O O 
they O O 
have O O

On O O 
Tuesday, O O 
U.S. O O 
Representative O O 
Jackie O O

told O O 
a O O 
congressional O O

that O O 
she O O 
personally O O 
knows O O 
of O O 
two O O 
current O O 
members O O 
of O O 
Congress O O 
that O O 
have O O 
“engaged O O 
in O O 
sexual O O 
harassment”… O O 

707451080
They O O 
want O O 
the O O 
system O O 
fixed O O 
and O O 
the O O 
perpetrators O O 
held O O 
accountable.” O O 

707451080
And O O 
Speier O O 
was O O 
the O O 
one O O 
that O O 
revealed O O 
the O O 
fact O O 
that O O 
15 O O 
million O O 
dollars O O 
have O O 
been O O 
paid O O 
out O O 
to O O 
victims O O 
of O O 
sexual O O 
harassment O O 
in O O 
the O O 
House O O 
in O O 
recent O O 
years. O O 

707451080
The O O 
following O O 
comes O O 
from O O 
Breitbart… O O 

707451080
Rep. O O 
Jackie O O 
Speier O O 
(D-CA) O O 
told O O 
MSNBC’s O O 
Chuck O O 
Todd O O 
on O O 
Meet O O 
the O O 
Press O O 
Daily O O 
on O O 
Tuesday O O 
that O O 
the O O 
U.S. O O 
House O O 
of O O 
Representatives O O 
has O O 
paid O O 
$15 O O 
million O O 
to O O 
alleged O O 
victims O O 
of O O 
sexual O O 
harassment O O 
by O O 
its O O 
own O O 
members O O 
in O O 
recent O O 
years. O O 

707451080
“We O O 
do O O 
know O O 
there O O 
is O O 
about O O 
$15 O O 
million O O 
that O O 
has O O 
been O O 
paid O O 
out O O 
by O O 
the O O 
House O O 
on O O 
behalf O O 
of O O 
harassers O O 
in O O 
the O O 
last O O 
ten O O 
to O O 
15 O O 
years,” O O 
she O O 
said. O O 

707451080
“15 O O 
million O O 
dollars O O 
has O O 
been O O 
paid O O 
out O O 
over O O 
sexual O O 
harassment O O 
claims,” O O 
Todd O O 
replied, O O 
somewhat O O 
shocked. O O 

707451080
“So, O O 
obviously O O 
more O O 
than O O 
one O O 
member O O 
of O O 
Congress.” O O 

707451080
If O O 
members O O 
of O O 
Congress O O 
are O O 
engaged O O 
in O O 
this O O 
type O O 
of O O 
behavior, O O 
why O Doubt 
don’t O Doubt 
the O Doubt 
American O Flag-Waving 
people O Doubt 
know O Doubt 
about O Doubt 
it? O Doubt 

707451080
And O O 
why O O 
are O O 
those O O 
members O O 
of O O 
Congress O O 
still O O 
allowed O O 
to O O 
serve? O O 

707451080
Representative O O 
Barbara O O 
Comstock O O 
also O O 
testified O O 
on O O 
Tuesday. O O 

707451080
Rep. O O 
Barbara O O 
Comstock O O 
(R-Va.) O O 
said O O 
at O O 
a O O 
House O O 
Administration O O 
Committee O O 
hearing O O 
on O O 
Tuesday O O 
that O O 
a O O 
sitting O O 
member O O 
of O O 
the O O 
U.S. O O 
Congress O O 
exposed O O 
himself O O 
to O O 
a O O 
young O O 
female O O 
staffer O O 
who O O 
delivered O O 
papers O O 
to O O 
his O O 
house–at O O 
his O O 
request. O O 

707451080
We O O 
need O O 
to O O 
be O O 
told O O 
who O O 
this O O 
member O O 
of O O 
Congress O O 
is O O 
so O O 
that O O 
he O O 
can O O 
be O O 
removed O O 
from O O 
Congress O O 
immediately. O O 

707451080
Here O O 
are O O 
the O O 
exact O O 
words O O 
that O O 
Comstock O O 
used O O 
as O O 
she O O 
described O O 
this O O 
incident… O O 

707451080
This O O 
member O O 
asked O O 
a O O 
staffer O O 
to O O 
bring O O 
them O O 
over O O 
some O O 
materials, O O 
to O O 
their O O 
residence. O O 

707451080
And O O 
the O O 
young O O 
staffer O O 
— O O 
it O O 
was O O 
a O O 
young O O 
woman O O 
— O O 
went O O 
there O O 
and O O 
was O O 
greeted O O 
with O O 
a O O 
member O O 
in O O 
a O O 
towel. O O 

707451080
It O O 
was O O 
a O O 
male, O O 
who O O 
then O O 
invited O O 
her O O 
in. O O 

707451080
And O O 
at O O 
that O O 
point, O O 
he O O 
decided O O 
to O O 
expose O O 
himself. O O 

707451080
She O O 
left, O O 
and O O 
then O O 
she O O 
quit O O 
her O O 
job. O O 

707451080
Of O O 
course, O O 
this O O 
sort O O 
of O O 
behavior O O 
is O O 
not O O 
just O O 
limited O O 
to O O 
members O O 
of O O 
Congress. O O 

707451080
In O O 
fact, O O 
things O O 
were O O 
so O O 
bad O O 
that O O 
at O O 
one O O 
point O O 
a O O 
Secret O O 
Service O O 
agent O O 
almost O O 
got O O 
into O O 
a O O 
fight O O 
with O O 
Biden. O O 

707451080
Here O O 
is O O 
more O O

Paul O O 
Joseph O O 
Watson… O O 

707451080
During O O 
one O O 
alleged O O 
incident O O 
in O O 
2009, O O 
Biden O O 
cupped O O 
the O O 
breast O O 
of O O 
a O O 
Secret O O 
Service O O 
agent’s O O 
girlfriend O O 
during O O 
a O O 
photo, O O 
prompting O O 
the O O 
agent O O 
to O O 
shove O O 
Biden O O 
and O O 
almost O O 
hit O O 
him. O O 

707451080
The O O 
agent O O 
was O O 
subsequently O O 
suspended O O 
for O O 
a O O 
week, O O 
according O O 
to O O 
the O O 
source. O O 

707451080
Men O O

often O O 
stand O O 
in O O

and O O 
Navy O O 
women O O 
or O O 
create O O

to O O 
have O O 
them O O 
leave O O

just O O 
to O O 
get O O 
them O O 
away O O 
from O O 
Biden, O O 
according O O 
to O O 
the O O 
agent. O O

Ellison O O

also O O 
deputy O O 
chairman O O 
of O O 
the O O

790499380
After O O 
the O O 
domestic O O 
abuse O O 
allegation O O 
emerged O O 
in O O 
August, O O 
the O O 
DNC O O 
said O O 
it O O 
is O O 
looking O O 
into O O 
what O O 
happened. O O 

790499380
“All O O 
allegations O O 
of O O 
domestic O O 
abuse O O 
are O O 
disturbing O O 
and O O 
should O O 
be O O 
taken O O 
seriously. O O 

790499380
We O O 
are O O 
working O O 
with O O 
the O O 
Minnesota O O 
state O O 
party O O 
to O O 
review O O 
these O O 
allegations,” O O 
a O O 
DNC O O 
spokeswoman O O 
said O O 
in O O 
a O O 
statement O O 
Wednesday O O 
morning, O O 
declining O O 
to O O 
comment O O 
further. O O 

790499380
The O O 
Democratic O O 
Party’s O O 
choice O O 
of O O 
Ellingstad O O 
to O O 
conduct O O 
the O O 
investigation O O 
was O O 
met O O 
with O O 
derision O Loaded_Language 
from O O 
many O O 
who O O 
said O O 
she O O 
is O O 
not O O 
independent, O O 
including O O 
Donald O O 
Trump O O 
Jr., O O 
who O O 
mocked O O 
the O O 
investigation O O 
in O O 
a O O 
Tweet O O 
Wednesday. O O 

790499380
The O O 
firm O O 
Ellingstad O O 
works O O 
for, O O 
Lockridge O O 
Grindal O O 
Nauen, O O 
has O O 
a O O 
political O O 
committee O O 
that O O 
has O O 
donated O O 
to O O 
both O O 
Republican O O 
and O O 
Democratic O O 
candidates, O O 
including O O 
Ellison, O O 
according O O 
to O O 
Federal O O 
Election O O 
Commission O O 
filings. O O 

790499380
The O O 
contributions O O 
to O O 
Democrats O O 
outweigh O O 
the O O 
Republicans O O 
by O O 
a O O 
margin O O 
of O O 
about O O 
four O O 
to O O 
one. O O 

790499380
As O O 
we O O 
previously O O 
reported: O O 

790499380
Rep. O O 
Keith O O 
Ellison, O O 
who O O 
is O O 
currently O O 
running O O 
for O O 
attorney O O 
general O O 
of O O 
Minnesota, O O 
is O O 
being O O 
accused O O 
of O O 
domestic O O 
violence O O 
against O O 
his O O 
former O O 
partner O O 
Karen O O 
Monahan. O O 

790499380
Austin O O 
Monahan, O O 
Karen O O 
Monahan’s O O 
son, O O 
aired O O 
the O O 
allegations O O 
in O O 
a O O 
Facebook O O 
post O O 
Saturday O O 
night. O O 

790499380
The O O 
alleged O O 
incident O O 
is O O 
just O O 
one O O 
of O O 
several, O O 
Austin O O 
Monahan O O 
warned. O O 

790499380
Ellison O O 
has O O 
admitted O O 
the O O 
relationship, O O 
but O O 
is O O 
denying O O 
the O O 
abuse. O O 

790499380
And O O 
the O O 
relationship O O 
was O O 
clearly O O 
real. O O 

790499380
Karen O O 
Monahan, O O 
an O O 
organizer O O 
with O O 
the O O 
Sierra O O 
Club, O O 
was O O 
in O O 
a O O 
relationship O O 
with O O 
Ellison O O 
for O O 
years. O O 

790499380
The O O 
two O O 
are O O 
seen O O 
together O O 
in O O 
many O O 
of O O 
her O O 
social O O 
media O O 
posts, O O 
including O O 
hiking O O 
in O O 
together O O 
national O O 
parks O O 
and O O 
posing O O 
with O O 
the O Name_Calling,Labeling 
Obamas O Name_Calling,Labeling 
at O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House. O O 

790499380
Records O O 
show O O 
she O O 
lived O O 
in O O 
his O O 
Minneapolis O O 
home O O 
before O O 
their O O 
relationship O O 
ended. O O 

790499380
Ellison, O O 
who O O 
was O O 
previously O O 
married O O 
to O O 
a O O 
different O O 
woman, O O 
is O O 
divorced. O O 

790499380
It's O O 
hard O O 
to O O 
know O O 
what O O 
really O O 
happened O O 
in O O 
a O O 
relationship. O O 

790499380
And O O 
the O O 
media O O 
has O O 
kept O O 
it O O 
quiet. O O 

790499380
"Keith O O 
Ellison O O 
flatly O O 
denies O O 
allegation O O 
that O O 
he O O 
abused O O 
an O O 
ex O O 
girlfriend. O O 

790499380
The O O 
story O O 
had O O 
been O O 
circulating O O 
in O O 
MN, O O 
and O O 
not O O 
held O O 
up O O 
under O O 
media O O 
scrutiny, O O 
so O O 
no O O 
stories O O 
ran. O O 

790499380
It O O 
blew O O 
up O Loaded_Language 
last O O 
night O O 
after O O 
the O O 
ex’s O O 
son O O 
posted O O 
the O O 
allegation O O 
on O O 
Facebook." O O 

790499380
Dave O O 
Weigel. O O 

790499380
It's O O 
not O O 
quite O O 
the O O 
first O O 
time O O 
for O O 
Keith O O 
X. O O 

790499380
This O O 
is O O 
not O O 
the O O 
first O O 
time O O 
Ellison O O 
has O O 
faced O O 
misconduct O O 
allegations. O O 

790499380
In O O 
2006, O O 
a O O 
woman O O 
named O O 
Amy O O 
Alexandar O O 
claimed O O 
that O O 
Ellison O O 
ostracized O Loaded_Language 
her O Loaded_Language 
and O Loaded_Language 
smeared O Loaded_Language 
her O Loaded_Language 
name O Loaded_Language 
after O O 
having O O 
an O O 
extramarital O O 
affair O O 
with O O 
her O O 
in O O 
the O O 
1990s O O 
and O O 
then O O 
again O O 
in O O 
the O O 
2000s. O O 

790499380
Ellison O O 
in O O 
2005 O O 
filed O O 
a O O 
restraining O O 
order O O 
against O O 
her O O 
after O O 
what O O 
he O O 
described O O 
as O O 
phone O O 
and O O 
email O O 
harassment. O O 

790499380
She O O 
subsequently O O 
tried O O 
to O O 
get O O 
a O O 
restraining O O 
order O O 
against O O 
him, O O 
which O O 
a O O 
judge O O 
denied, O O 
ordering O O 
her O O 
to O O 
stop O O 
repeating O O 
allegations O O 
of O O 
an O O 
affair O O 
or O O 
intimidation. O O 

790499380
Ellison O O 
subsequently O O 
agreed O O 
to O O 
dismiss O O 
his O O 
restraining O O 
order O O 
against O O 
her O O 
if O O 
she O O 
no O O 
longer O O 
contacted O O 
him. O O 

790499380
I'm O O 
not O O 
sure O O 
that O O 
this O O 
is O O 
nothing O O 
more O O 
than O O 
damage O Loaded_Language 
control O O 
just O O 
before O O 
the O O 
elections. O O 

790499380
Ellison O O 
won O O 
the O O 
primary O O 
days O O 
after O O 
the O O 
allegations O O 
were O O 
made O O 
public. O O 

790499380
Of O O 
course, O O 
accusations O O 
does O O 
not O O 
make O O 
one O O 
guilty O O 
for O O 
Ellison O O 
anymore O O 
than O O 
they O O 
do O O 
for O O 
Judge O O 
Kavanaugh. O O 

790499380
However, O O 
at O O 
least O O 
in O O 
the O O 
case O O 
of O O 
Ellison, O O 
at O O 
least O O 
one O O 
of O O 
the O O 
women O O 
were O O 
not O O 
scared O O 
about O O 
their O O 
reputation O O 
and O O 
had O O 
any O O 
political O O 
motive O O 
to O O 
call O O 
the O O 
police O O 
and O O 
file O O 
a O O 
report. O O 

790499380
Judge O O 
Kavanaugh O O 
has O O 
faced O O 
it O O 
all O O 
and O O 
fought O O 
back O O 
against O O 
it. O O 

788626289
And O O 
that O O 
shows O O 
that O O 
all O O 
their O O 
#MeToo Slogans O 
rhetoric O O 
is O O 
pure O O 
politically-motivated O Loaded_Language 
hypocrisy Loaded_Language Loaded_Language 
— O Loaded_Language 
as O O 
if O O 
anyone O O 
didn’t O O 
know O O 
that O O 
by O O 
now. O O

Stacey O O

ended O O 
her O O 
run O O 
for O O 
Georgia O O 
governor O O 
on O O 
Friday, O O 
but O O 
the O O

she O O 
would O O 
not O O 
concede O O 
the O O 
contest O O 
to O O

999001256
As O O 
state O O 
officials O O 
prepare O O 
to O O 
certify O O 
the O O 
vote, O O 
Abrams O O 
acknowledged O O 
the O O 
law O O 
“allows O O 
no O O

to O O 
extend O O 
her O O

999001256

she O O 
laced O O 
her O O 
speech O O 
with O O 
biting O Loaded_Language 
criticism O Loaded_Language 
of O Loaded_Language 
Kemp, O O 
who O O 
she O O 
accused O O 
of O O

role O O 
as O O 
the O O

top O O

official O O 
to O O

999001256
“I O O 
will O O 
not O O 
concede,” O O 
she O O 
added, O O 
“because O O 
the O O 
erosion O O 
of O O 
our O O 
democracy O O 
is O O 
not O O 
right.” O O 

999001256

all O O 
be O O 
coming O O 
from O O 
the O O

that O O

but O O 
she's O O 
not O O 
going O O 
to O O 
talk O O 
about O O 
that. O O 

999001256
But O O 
she O O 
wasn't O O 
going O O 
to O O 
concede. O O

simply O O

bow O O 
out O O 
gracefully. O O 

999001256
“So, O O 
let’s O O 
be O O 
clear," O O 
she O O 
continued. O O 

999001256
"This O O 
is O O 
not O O 
a O O 
speech O O 
of O O 
concession. O O 

999001256

concession O O

999001256
As O O

I O O 
cannot O O 
concede O O 
that. O O

But O O 
my O O 
assessment O O 
is O O 
the O O 
law O O 
currently O O 
allows O O 
no O O 
further O O

999001256
No, O O 
concession O O 
means O O 
"a O O 
thing O O 
that O O

in O O

The O O

also O O 
asked O O 
that O O 
provisional O O 
ballots O O 
cast O O 
by O O 
a O O

999001259
The O O 
lawsuit O O 
says O O 
that O O 
of O O 
the O O 
1,556 O O 
provisional O O

Fulton O O 
County O O 
reported O O 
having O O 
rejected O O 
by O O 
Nov. O O 
9, O O 
nearly O O 
1,000 O O

disqualified O O 
because O O 
they O O 
were O O 
cast O O 
by O O

an O O

adviser O O 
at O O

said O O 
these O O 
uncounted O O 
provisional O O

could O O 
sway O O 
the O O

and, O O 
despite O O 
Kemp’s O O 
claims, O O 
his O O 
unofficial O O 
vote O O 
total O O 
is O O 
so O O 
close O O 
to O O 
50 O O 
percent, O O 
a O O 
runoff O O 
is O O 
possible. O O

Kemp O O

up O O 
50.2 O O

early O O 
Tuesday. O O

More O O 
than O O 
3.9 O O 
million O O 
votes O O 
were O O 
cast O O 
in O O 
the O O

and O O 
Abrams O O 
would O O 
need O O

acquire O O 
more O O

20,000 O O 
additional O O

to O O 
force O O 
a O O

Abrams’ O O

to O O 
Mr. O O

— O O 
whose O O

touched O Loaded_Language 
off O O 
Mr. O Loaded_Language

— O Loaded_Language 
the O O 
administration O Repetition 
used O O 
the O O 
occasion O O 
to O O 
lay O O 
down O O 
a O O 
set O O 
of O O 
formal O O 
rules O O 
governing O O 
reporters’ O O 
behavior O O 
at O O 
future O O 
White O O

news O O 
conferences, O O 
a O O 
highly O O 
unusual O O 
step. O O 

111111133
The O O 
White O O 
House O O 
sought O O 
to O O 
blame O O 
Mr. O O 
Acosta O O 
for O O 
behaving O O 
disrespectfully, O O 
although O O 
Mr. O O

often O O 
lobs O O 
insults Loaded_Language O 
at O O

and O O 
encourages O O 
a O O 
free-for-all O O 
format O O 
when O O 
taking O O

from O O 
reporters. O O 

111111133
Codifying O O 
the O O 
behavior O O 
of O O

struck O Loaded_Language 
some O O 
as O O 
an O Loaded_Language 
ominous Loaded_Language Loaded_Language 
encroachment Loaded_Language Loaded_Language 
into O Loaded_Language 
freedom O Loaded_Language 
of O Loaded_Language 
the O O 
press, O Loaded_Language 
and O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House O O 
Correspondents’ O O 
Association O O 
said O O 
on O O 
Monday O O 
that O O 
it O O 
had O O 
not O O 
been O O 
consulted O O 
about O O 
the O O 
new O O 
guidelines. O O 

111111133
Mr. O O

often O O 
chastised O Loaded_Language 
reporters, O O 
including O O 
Mr. O O

on O O 
one O O 
occasion, O O 
for O O

he O O 
deemed O O 
overly Loaded_Language O

a O Name_Calling,Labeling

consumer Name_Calling,Labeling Name_Calling,Labeling

111111133
Revoking O O 
Mr. O O

was O O 
the O Exaggeration,Minimisation

severe Loaded_Language Exaggeration,Minimisation 
step O Exaggeration,Minimisation 
yet, O Exaggeration,Minimisation 
and O O 
it O O 
soon O O 
became O O 
apparent O O 
that O O 
the O O 
move O O 
would O O 
not O O 
pass O O 
legal O O 
muster: O O 
After O O 
suing O O 
last O O 
week, O O 
Mr. O O 
Acosta O O 
was O O 
granted O O 
the O O 
temporary O O 
return O O 
of O O 
his O O 
credentials O O 
by O O 
a O O 
federal O O 
judge. O O 

111111133
The O O 
aides O O 
complain O O 
about O O 
reporters O O 
who O O 
they O O 
say O O 
do O O 
not O O 
respect O O 
the O O 
solemnity O O 
of O O 
the O O 
setting, O O 
even O O 
as O O 
Mr. O O 
Trump O O 
flouts Loaded_Language O 
many O O 
of O O 
the O O 
norms O O 
associated O O 
with O O 
his O O 
office. O O 

111111133
That O O 
notion O O 
read O O 
more O O 
like O O 
a O O 
warning O O 
— O O 
behave Black-and-White_Fallacy O 
or Black-and-White_Fallacy O 
else Black-and-White_Fallacy O 
— O O 
and O O 
the O O

Association O O 
seemed O O 
unmoved. O O

111111133
Jim O O

has O O 
his O O

back. O O 

111111133
The O Repetition 
Trump O Repetition 
administration O Repetition 
stood O O 
down O O 
on O O 
Monday O O 
from O O 
its O O 
nearly O O 
two-week-long O O 
dispute O O 
with O O 
CNN O O 
over O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House O O 
credentials O O 
of O O 
Mr. O O 
Acosta, O O 
informing O O 
the O O 
correspondent O O 
that O O 
his O O 
badge O O 
was O O 
formally O O 
restored. O O 

111111133
Among O O 
the O O 
guidelines O O 
was O O 
a O O 
restriction O O 
of O O 
one O O 
question O O 
per O O 
reporter, O O 
with O O 
follow-ups O O 
allowed O O 
at O O 
the O O 
discretion O O 
of O O 
the O O 
president O O 
or O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House O O 
official O O 
at O O 
the O O 
lectern. O O 

111111133
“Failure O O 
to O O 
abide,” O O 
the O O 
administration O O 
warned, O O 
“may O O 
result O O 
in O O 
suspension O O 
or O O 
revocation O O 
of O O 
the O O 
journalist’s O O 
hard O O 
pass.” O O 

111111133
The O O 
American O O 
Civil O O 
Liberties O O 
Union, O O 
in O O 
a O O 
statement, O O 
said: O O 
“These O O 
rules O O 
give O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House O O 
far O O 
too O O 
much O O 
discretion O O 
to O O 
avoid O O 
real O O 
scrutiny. O O 

111111133
The O O 
White O O 
House O O 
belongs O O 
to O O 
the O O 
public, O O 
not O O 
the O O 
president, O O 
and O O 
the O O 
job O O 
of O O 
the O O 
press O O 
is O O 
to O O 
ask O O 
hard O O 
questions, O O 
not O O 
to O O 
be O O 
polite O O 
company.” O O 

111111133
Still, O O 
the O O 
guidelines O O 
are O O 
not O O 
far O O 
removed O O 
from O O 
the O O 
manner O O 
in O O 
which O O 
White O O 
House O O 
news O O 
conferences O O 
typically O O 
proceed. O O 

111111133
Mr. O O 
Trump O O 
made O O 
clear O O 
last O O 
week O O 
that O O 
he O O 
would O O 
introduce O O 
“regulations” O O 
after O O 
a O O 
federal O O 
judge O O 
criticized O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House O O 
for O O 
stripping O O 
Mr. O O 
Acosta’s O O 
credentials O O 
without O O 
due O O 
process O O 
or O O 
a O O 
coherent O O 
rationale. O O 

111111133
“We O O 
would O O 
have O O 
greatly O O 
preferred O O 
to O O 
continue O O 
hosting O O 
White O O 
House O O 
press O O 
conferences O O 
in O O 
reliance O O 
on O O 
a O O 
set O O 
of O O 
understood O O 
professional O O 
norms, O O 
and O O 
we O O 
believe O O 
the O O 
overwhelming O O 
majority O O 
of O O 
journalists O O 
covering O O 
the O O 
White O O 
House O O 
share O O 
that O O 
preference,” O O 
Sarah O O 
Huckabee O O 
Sanders, O O 
the O O 
press O O 
secretary, O O 
said O O 
in O O 
a O O 
statement. O O 

111111133
Press O O 
relations O O 
were O O 
not O O 
always O O 
rosy O O 
in O O 
pre-Trump O O 
days. O O 

111111133
President O O 
Barack O O 
Obama’s O O 
aides O O 
preselected O O 
the O O 
news O O 
outlets O O 
that O O 
were O O 
allowed O O 
to O O 
ask O O 
questions O O 
at O O 
his O O 
news O O 
conferences. O O 

111111133
He O O 
has O O 
held O O 
far O O 
fewer O O 
formal O O 
news O O 
conferences O O 
than O O 
his O O 
predecessors, O O 
and O O 
the O O 
daily O O 
White O O 
House O O 
briefing O O 
has O O 
virtually O O 
disappeared O O 
on O O 
his O O 
watch. O O 

111111133
A O O 
back-and-forth O O 
ensued O O 
over O O 
the O O 
weekend. O O 

111111133
Bill O O 
Shine, O O 
the O O 
deputy O O 
chief O O 
of O O 
staff O O 
for O O 
communications, O O 
sent O O 
a O O 
letter O O 
to O O 
Mr. O O 
Acosta O O 
that O O 
listed O O 
several O O 
reasons O O 
that O O 
his O O 
pass O O 
had O O 
been O O 
revoked, O O 
perhaps O O 
an O O 
attempt O O 
to O O 
satisfy O O 
the O O 
judge’s O O 
request O O 
for O O 
a O O 
clear O O 
rationale. O O 

111111133
CNN’s O O 
lawyers O O 
called O O 
the O O 
note O O 
an O O 
“after-the-fact O O 
concocted O O 
process.” O O 
By O O 
Monday O O 
afternoon, O O 
the O O 
sides O O 
had O O 
reached O O 
a O O 
resolution. O O 

111111133
Aides O O 
to O O 
Mr. O O 
Trump O O 
say O O 
that O O 
the O O 
president O O 
does O O 
not O O 
mind O O 
answering O O 
questions, O O 
pointing O O 
to O O 
his O O 
numerous O O 
impromptu O O 
sessions O O 
with O O 
reporters O O 
during O O 
White O O 
House O O 
photo-ops O O 
and O O

111111133
“The O O 
White O O 
House’s O O 
interaction O O 
is, O O 
and O O 
generally O O 
should O O 
be, O O 
subject O O 
to O O 
a O O 
natural O O 
give-and-take,” O O 
Ms. O O 
Sanders O O 
wrote O O 
on O O 
Monday, O O 
suggesting O O 
that O O 
the O O 
onus O Loaded_Language 
was O O 
on O O 
the O O 
press O O 
corps O O 
to O O 
ensure O O 
that O O 
a O O 
“code O O

did O O 
not O O 
become O O 
necessary. O O 

111111133
“For O O

there O O

on O O

apparently O O

the O O

702111021
Saris O O

to O O

to O O 
the O O

in O O 
the O O

all O O

we O O 
have O O 
here O O 
is O O 
that O O

Tedros O O 
said O O 
Wednesday O O 
the O O

stood O O 
at O O 
207. O O 

111111111
The O O 
larger-than-usual O O

had O O 
helped O O 
spread O O 
the O O

that O O

the O O

more O O 
widely. O O 

111111111
Complicating O O 
vector O O

is O O 
the O O 
fact O O 
that O O

761568202
Former O O 
president O O 
Bill O O 
Clinton O O 
has O O 
spoken O O 
out O O 
about O O 
what O O 
happened O O 
during O O 
his O O 
affair O O 
with O O 
former O O 
White O O 
House O O 
intern O O 
Monica O O 
Lewinsky. O O 

761568202
Among O O 
other O O 
things, O O 
Clinton O O 
says O O 
Lewinsky O O 
is O O 
not O O 
owed O O 
an O O 
apology O O 
from O O 
him O O 
and O O 
he O O 
“did O O 
the O O 
right O O 
thing.” O O 

761568202
As O O 
reported O O 
by O O 
CNN, O O 
Speaking O O 
to O O 
Today, O O 
Clinton O O 
defended O O 
his O O 
decision O O 
to O O 
remain O O 
in O O 
office O O 
following O O 
the O O 
scandal. O O 

761568202
“I O O 
think O O 
I O O 
did O O 
the O O 
right O O 
thing. O O 

761568202
I O O 
defended O O 
the O O 
Constitution.” O O 

761568202
In O O 
an O O 
essay O O 
for O O 
Vanity O O 
Fair O O 
published O O 
earlier O O 
this O O 
year, O O 
Lewinsky O O 
said O O 
she O O 
was O O 
questioning O O 
the O O 
narrative O O 
surrounding O O 
the O O 
affair, O O 
which O O 
played O O 
a O O 
central O O 
role O O 
in O O 
Clinton’s O O 
eventual O O 
impeachment. O O 

761568202
“Now, O O 
at O O 
44, O O 
I’m O O 
beginning O O 
(just O O 
beginning) O O 
to O O 
consider O O 
the O O 
implications O O 
of O O 
power O O 
differentials O O 
that O O 
were O O 
so O O 
vast O O 
between O O 
a O O 
president O O 
and O O 
a O O 
White O O 
House O O 
intern,” O O 
she O O 
wrote. O O 

761568202
“I’m O O 
beginning O O 
to O O 
entertain O O 
the O O 
notion O O 
that O O 
in O O 
such O O 
a O O 
circumstance O O 
the O O 
idea O O 
of O O 
consent O O 
might O O 
well O O 
be O O 
rendered O O 
moot.” O O 

761568202
When O O 
asked O O 
if O O 
he O O 
owed O O 
Lewinsky O O 
an O O 
apology, O O 
President O O 
Clinton O O 
told O O 
NBC‘s O O 
Craig O O 
Melvin, O O 
“No, O O 
I O O 
do O O 
not O O 
— O O 
I O O 
have O O 
never O O 
talked O O 
to O O 
her. O O 

761568202
But O O 
I O O 
did O O 
say O O 
publicly O O 
on O O 
more O O 
than O O 
one O O 
occasion O O 
that O O 
I O O 
was O O 
sorry. O O 

761568202
That’s O O 
very O O 
different. O O 

761568202
The O O 
apology O O 
was O O 
public.” O O 
Although O O 
some O O 
may O O 
not O O 
have O O 
taken O O 
what O O 
Clinton O O 
said O O 
as O O 
an O O 
apology, O O 
he O O 
did O O 
publicly O O 
acknowledge O O 
at O O 
the O O 
National O O 
Prayer O O 
Breakfast O O 
in O O 
1998 O O 
that O O 
he O O 
had O O 
“sinned.” O O 

761568202
“I O O 
don’t O O 
think O O 
there O O 
is O O 
a O O 
fancy O O 
way O O 
to O O 
say O O 
that O O 
I O O 
have O O

John O O 
McCain O O 
(R-Ariz.) O O 
said O O 
Americans O O 
need O O 
answers O O 
about O O 
her O O 
past O O 
involvement O O 
in O O 
state O O 
sponsored O O 
torture O O 
programs. O O 

738442776
As O O 
I O O 
noted O O 
earlier O O 
today, O O 
Haspel’s O O 
long O O 
career O O 
at O O 
the O O 
CIA O O 
spanned O O 
the O O 
years O O 
of O O 
torture O O 
carried O O 
out O O 
under O O 
the O O 
George O O 
W. O O 
Bush O O 
White O O 
House. O O 

738442776
In O O 
a O O 
lengthy O O 
statement O O 
following O O 
Haspel’s O O 
nomination, O O 
McCain O O 
expressed O O 
big O O 
concerns O O 
about O O 
what O O 
it O O 
means O O 
for O O 
the O O 
agency’s O O 
future, O O 
saying: O O 

738442776
During O O 
his O O 
own O O 
confirmation O O 
proceedings O O 
for O O 
Director O O 
of O O 
the O O 
CIA, O O 
Mike O O 
Pompeo O O 
repeatedly O O 
committed O O 
that O O 
he O O 
would O O 
comply O O 
with O O 
the O O 
law O O 
that O O 
applies O O 
the O O 
Army O O 
Field O O 
Manual’s O O 
interrogation O O 
requirements O O 
to O O 
all O O 
U.S. O O 
agencies, O O 
including O O 
the O O 
CIA. O O 

738442776
The O Flag-Waving 
American O Flag-Waving 
people O Flag-Waving 
now O O 
deserve O O 
the O O 
same O O 
assurances O O 
from O O 
Gina O O 
Haspel, O O 
whose O O 
career O O 
with O O 
the O O 
agency O O 
has O O 
intersected O O 
with O O 
the O O 
program O O 
of O O 
so-called O O 
‘enhanced O O 
interrogation O O 
techniques’ O O 
on O O 
a O O 
number O O 
of O O 
occasions. O O 

738442776
Ms. O O 
Haspel O O 
needs O O 
to O O 
explain O O 
the O O 
nature O O 
and O O 
extent O O 
of O O 
her O O 
involvement O O 
in O O 
the O O 
CIA’s O O 
interrogation O O 
program O O 
during O O 
the O O 
confirmation O O 
process. O O 

738442776
I O O 
know O O 
the O O 
Senate O O 
will O O 
do O O 
its O O 
job O O 
in O O 
examining O O 
Ms. O O 
Haspel’s O O 
record O O 
as O O 
well O O 
as O O 
her O O 
beliefs O O 
about O O 
torture O O 
and O O 
her O O 
approach O O 
to O O 
current O O 
law. O O 

738442776
Current O O 
U.S. O O 
law O O 
is O O 
clear O O 
in O O 
banning O O 
enhanced O O 
interrogation O O 
techniques. O O

of O O 
the O O 
South O O 
Side O O 
Flats O O 
in O O 
the O O

was O O 
home O O 
alone O O 
when O O 
Guyger O O 
mistook O O 
his O O 
apartment O O 
for O O 
hers, O O 
the Repetition O 
affidavit Repetition O 
says. Repetition O 

786004130
Guyger O O 
lived O O 
on O O 
the O O 
third O O 
floor, O O 
directly O O 
beneath O O 
his O O 
apartment, O O 
and O O 
mistakenly O O 
parked O O

after O O 
finishing O O 
a O O

at O O

the Repetition O 
affidavit Repetition O

786004130
When O O 
she O O 
arrived O O 
at O O 
Jean's O O 
door, O O 
Guyger O O 
entered O O 
a O O 
unique O O 
door O O 
key O O 
with O O 
an O O 
electronic O O 
chip O O 
into O O 
the O O

the Repetition O

786004130
The Repetition O 
affidavit Repetition O 
says Repetition O 
the O O 
apartments' O O 
"respective O O 
interior O O

are O O 
in O O 
most O O 
ways O O 
identical O O 
or O O 
extremely O O 
similar." O O 

786004130
The O O 
apartment O O 
was O O 
dark O O 
and O O 
when O O 
she O O 
saw O O 
"a O O 
large O O 
silhouette," O O 
Guyger O O 
thought O O 
she O O 
was O O 
being O O 
burglarized, O O 
the Repetition O 
affidavit Repetition O 
says. Repetition O 

786004130
The Repetition O 
affidavit Repetition O 
says Repetition O 
Guyger O O 
drew O O 
her O O 
gun, O O 
"gave O O 
verbal O O 
commands O O 
that O O 
were O O 
ignored" O O 
and O O 
fired O O 
twice. O O 

786004130
She O O 
turned O O 
on O O 
the O O 
lights, O O 
then O O 
went O O 
to O O 
the O O 
front O O 
door O O 
again O O 
and O O 
realized O O 
the O O 
apartment O O 
wasn't O O 
hers, O O 
the Repetition O 
affidavit Repetition O 
says. Repetition O 

786004130
She O O 
told O O 
the O O 
911 O O 
operator O O 
as O O 
well O O 
as O O

that O O 
she O O

One O O 
of O O

was O O 
trying O O

Last O O 
week, O O 
it O O 
was O O 
reported O O 
that O O 
Dallas O O 
Police O O 
Officer O O 
Amber O O 
Guyger O O 
entered O O 
an O O 
apartment O O 
she O O 
claims O O 
that O O 
she O O 
thought O O

and O O 
subsequently O O 
found O O 
the O O 
occupant O O 
of O O 
that O O

and O O 
shot O O 
and O O 
killed O O 
him, O O 
claiming O O 
she O O 
thought O O 
he O O 
was O O 
an O O

786004130
Now, O O 
after O O 
several O O 
days O O

from O O 
the O O

Guyger O O

In O O 
a O O 
statement O O

their O O 
officer O O 
called O O 
them O O 
after O O 
shooting O O 
Jean O O

told O O

Preliminary O O 
information O O 
suggests O O 
that O O 
the O O 
officer O O 
arrived O O 
home O O 
in O O 
full O O 
uniform O O 
after O O 
working O O 
a O O 
full O O 
shift. O O 

786004130
The O O 
officer O O 
reported O O 
to O O 
the O O 
responding O O 
officers O O 
that O O 
she O O 
entered O O 
the O O 
victim’s O O 
apartment O O 
believing O O 
that O O 
it O O 
was O O 
her O O 
own. O O 

786004130
At O O 
some O O 
point, O O 
the O O 
officer O O 
fired O O 
her O O 
weapon O O 
striking O O 
the O O 
victim. O O 

786004130
Responding O O 
officers O O 
administered O O 
aid O O 
to O O 
the O O 
victim, O O 
a O O 
26-year-old O O 
male, O O 
at O O 
the O O 
scene. O O 

786004130
The O O 
victim O O 
was O O 
then O O 
transported O O 
to O O 
the O O 
hospital O O 
and O O 
pronounced O O 
deceased. O O 

786004130
Next O O 
of O O 
kin O O 
notification O O 
has O O 
not O O 
been O O 
made O O 
at O O 
this O O 
time. O O 

786004130
The O O 
officer O O 
was O O 
not O O 
injured O O 
and O O 
will O O 
be O O 
placed O O 
on O O 
administrative O O 
leave O O 
pending O O 
the O O 
outcome O O 
of O O 
the O O 
investigation. O O 

786004130
The O O 
Dallas O O 
Police O O 
Department O O 
is O O 
conducting O O 
a O O 
joint O O 
investigation O O 
with O O 
the O O 
District O O 
Attorney’s O O 
Office. O O 

786004130
This O O 
investigation O O 
is O O 
ongoing O O 
and O O 
we O O 
will O O 
release O O 
additional O O 
details O O 
as O O 
they O O 
become O O 
available O O 
and O O 
it O O 
is O O 
appropriate O O 
to O O 
do O O 
so. O O 

786004130
I O O 
have O O 
no O O 
idea O O 
how O O 
you O O 
can O O 
enter O O 
an O O 
apartment O O 
mistakenly. O O 

786004130
Does O O 
Guyger O O 
leave O O 
her O O 
door O O 
unlocked? O O 

786004130
Furthermore, O O 
The O O 
Dallas O O 
News O O 
reports: O O 

786004130
The O O 
door O O 
was O O 
already O O 
ajar, O O 
so O O 
the O O 
force O O 
of O O 
pushing O O 
the O O 
key O O 
inside O O 
opened O O 
the O O 
door, O O 
according O O 
to O O 
the O O 
affidavit. O O 

786004130
Jean O O 
was O O 
struck O O 
once O O 
in O O 
the O O 
torso. O O 

786004130
Guyger O O 
then O O 
called O O 
911 O O 
from O O 
her O O 
cellphone O O 
and O O 
started O O 
performing O O 
first O O 
aid. O O 

786004130
Ok, O O 
some O O 
of O O 
this O O 
seems O O 
plausible, O O 
but O O 
I O O 
still O O 
am O O 
left O O 
wondering O O 
about O O 
the O O 
door O O 
being O O 
ajar. O O 

786004130
Is O O 
this O O 
something O O 
people O O 
are O O 
prone O O 
to O O 
do O O 
at O O 
1o O O 
o'clock O O 
at O O 
night O O 
in O O 
Dallas? O O 

786004130
In O O 
any O O 
case, O O 
we O O 
all O O 
know O O 
that O O 
any O O 
of O O 
us O O 
who O O 
did O O 
the O O 
same O O 
thing O O 
would O O 
have O O 
immediately O O 
been O O 
taken O O 
into O O 
custody. O O 

786004130
This O O 
was O O 
not O O 
the O O 
case O O 
with O O 
Guyger, O O 
though O O 
one O O 
officer O O 
close O O 
to O O 
her O O 
said, O O 
"she O O 
is O O 
devastated." O Loaded_Language 

786004130
Knowing O O 
this O O 
provoked O O 
outrage O Loaded_Language 
across O O 
the O O 
nation O O 
over O O 
the O O 
weekend. O O 

786004130
In O O 
fact, O O 
this O O 
is O O 
not O O 
her O O 
first O O 
shooting. O O 

786004130
As O O 
a O O 
four-year O O 
veteran O O 
of O O 
the O O 
force, O O 
she O O 
was O O 
also O O 
involved O O 
in O O 
the O O 
shooting O O 
of O O 
another O O 
suspect O O 
in O O 
2017. O O 

786004130
The O O 
Dallas O O 
News O O 
reported: O O 

786004130
In O O 
2017, O O 
Guyger O O 
shot O O 
47-year-old O O 
Uvaldo O O 
Perez, O O 
who O O 
had O O 
wrestled O O 
a O O 
Taser O O 
away O O 
from O O 
her. O O 

786004130
Another O O 
officer O O 
had O O 
been O O 
in O O 
a O O 
Pleasant O O 
Grove O O 
neighborhood O O 
looking O O 
for O O 
a O O 
woman O O 
who O O 
had O O 
a O O 
warrant O O 
out O O 
for O O 
her O O 
arrest. O O 

786004130
When O O 
the O O 
officer O O 
thought O O 
he O O 
saw O O 
the O O 
woman O O 
in O O 
a O O 
car O O 
with O O 
two O O 
men O O 
in O O 
the O O 
8300 O O 
block O O 
of O O 
Reva O O 
Street, O O 
the O O 
officer O O 
asked O O 
for O O 
backup O O 
from O O 
Guyger O O 
and O O 
another O O 
officer, O O 
according O O 
to O O 
an O O 
affidavit. O O 

786004130
Guyger O O 
deployed O O 
her O O 
Taser O O 
before O O 
Perez O O 
was O O 
able O O 
to O O 
take O O 
it O O 
from O O 
her. O O 

786004130
After O O 
Perez O O 
had O O 
the O O 
Taser, O O 
Guyger O O 
fired O O 
her O O 
gun O O 
once, O O 
striking O O 
him O O 
in O O 
the O O 
abdomen, O O 
the O O 
affidavit O O 
said. O O 

786004130
Neither O O 
Guyger O O 
nor O O 
the O O 
other O O 
officers O O 
were O O 
injured O O 
in O O 
the O O 
2017 O O 
shooting. O O 

786004130

786004130
In O O

for O O 
the O O

IN O O 
MAY O O 
2013, O O 
the O O 
Washington O O 
Post’s O O 
Greg O O 
Miller O O 
reported O O 
that O O 
the O O

was O O 
being O O 
shifted O O

as O O 
a O O 
result O O 
of O O 
“a O O 
management O O 
shake-up” O O 
by O O 
then-Director O O 
John O O 
Brennan. O O 

738542398
As O O 
Miller O O 
put O O 
it, O O 
she O O 
was O O 
“directly O O 
involved O O 
in O O 
its O O 
controversial O O 
interrogation O O 
program” O O 
and O O 
had O O 
an O O 
“extensive O O 
role” O O 
in O O 
torturing O O 
detainees. O O 

738542398
Beyond O O 
all O O 
that, O O 
she O O 
played O O 
a O O 
vital O O 
role O O 
in O O 
the O O 
destruction O O 
of O O 
interrogation O O 
videotapes O O 
that O O 
showed O O 
the O O 
torture O O 
of O O

both O O 
at O O

A O O

the O O

on O O

two O O

after O O 
she O O 
was O O

in O O 
the O O 
fatal O O 
shooting O O 
of O O

of O O 
the O O

Botham O O 
Jean, O O 
and O O 
fatally O O 
shot O O 
him O O 
Sept O O

When O O 
she O O 
was O O 
arrested O O 
three O O 
days O O 
later O O 
on O O 
manslaughter O O 
charges, O O 
Guyger O O 
said O O 
she O O 
confused O O 
Jean’s O O 
home O O 
for O O 
her O O 
own, O O 
confused O O 
Jean O O 
for O O 
an O O

and O O 
shot O O 
him O O 
when O O 
he O O 
refused O O 
her O O 
commands, O O 
according O O 
to O O 
court O O 
documents. O O 

111111121
The O O

criticism O O 
against O O 
the O O 
police O O 
department, O O 
which O O 
waited O O 
days O O 
to O O 
arrest O O 
Guyger, O O 
then O O 
went O O 
weeks O O 
without O O 
disciplining O O 
her O O 
even O O 
though O O 
she O O 
was O O 
placed O O 
on O O

“The O O

about O O

explanations O O 
last O O

for O O 
why O O 
she O O 
could O O 
not O O 
fire O O 
the O O

111111121
She O O 
told O O 
a O O

until O O 
a O O

wrapped O O 
up O O 
— O O 
probably O O 
months O O

111111121
In O O 
a O O 
statement, O O 
Hall O O 
said O O 
that O O 
any O O

would O O 
risk O O 
compromising O O 
the O O

111111121
“That O O

she O O

111111121
Police O O 
did O O 
not O O 
explain O O 
what O O 
changed O O 
by O O 
Monday, O O 
when O O 
the O O

announced O O 
that O O 
an O O

already O O 
“concluded” O O

The O O

her O O

As O O

the O O 
more O O

legal O O 
questions O O 
are O O 
whether O O 
Guyger O O 
is O O 
prosecuted O O 
as O O 
a O O

civilian O O

took O O 
in O O

at O O 
a O O 
Congressional O O 
Black O O 
Caucus O O 
meeting, O O 
but O O 
did O O 
not O O 
make O O 
public O O 
because O O 
he O O 
believed O O 
it O O 
would O O 
have O O 
“made O Flag-Waving 
a O O 
difference” O Flag-Waving 
to O Flag-Waving 
Obama’s O Flag-Waving 
political O Flag-Waving

The O O 
photographer, O O 
Askia O O 
Muhammad, O O 
told O O 
the O O 
Trice O O 
Edney O O 
News O O 
Wire O O 
that O O 
he O O 
“gave O O 
the O O 
picture O O 
up O O 
at O O 
the O O 
time O O 
and O O 
basically O O 
swore O O 
secrecy.” O O 
“But O O 
after O O 
the O O 
nomination O O 
was O O 
secured O O 
and O O 
all O O 
the O O 
way O O 
up O O 
until O O 
the O O 
inauguration; O O 
then O O 
for O O 
eight O O 
years O O 
after O O 
he O O 
was O O 
President, O O 
it O O 
was O O 
kept O O 
under O O 
cover,” O O 
Muhammad O O 
said. O O 

725824328
Asked O O 
whether O O 
he O O 
thought O O 
the O O 
photo’s O O 
release O O 
would O O 
have O O 
affected O O 
Obama’s O O 
presidential O O 
campaign, O O 
Muhammad O O 
said, O O 
“I O O 
insist. O O 

725824328
TPM O O 
has O O 
published O O 
the O O 
photo O O 
above O O 
with O O 
Muhammad’s O O 
permission. O O 

725824328
“I O O 
sort O O 
of O O 
understood O O 
what O O 
was O O 
going O O 
on,” O O 
Muhammad O O 
told O O 
TPM. O O 

725824328
“I O O 
promised O O 
and O O 
made O O 
arrangements O O 
to O O 
give O O 
the O O 
picture O O 
to O O 
Leonard O O 
Farrakhan,” O O 
the O O 
minister’s O O 
son-in-law O O 
and O O 
chief O O 
of O O 
staff. O O 

725824328
Muhammad O O 
said O O 
he O O 
gave O O 
away O O 
“the O O 
disk” O O 
from O O 
his O O 
camera O O 
but O O 
“copied O O 
the O O 
photograph O O 
from O O 
that O O 
day O O 
onto O O 
a O O 
file” O O 
on O O 
his O O 
computer. O O 

725824328
“Realizing O O 
that O O 
I O O 
had O O 
given O O 
it O O 
up, O O 
I O O 
mean, O O 
it O O 
was O O 
sort O O 
of O O 
like O O 
a O O 
promise O O 
to O O 
keep O O 
the O O 
photograph O O 
secret,” O O 
Muhammad O O 
said. O O 

725824328
Muhammad O O 
said O O 
he O O 
did O O 
not O O 
release O O 
his O O 
copy O O 
of O O 
the O O 
photograph O O 
because O O 
he O O 
thought O O 
it O O 
would O O 
be O O 
perceived O O 
as O O 
a O O 
betrayal O O 
of O O 
that O O 
promise: O O 
“I O O 
was O O 
really, O O 
I O O 
guess, O O 
afraid O O 
of O O 
them.” O O

what O O 
happened O O 
to O O

725824328
Muhammad O O 
contacted O O 
Farrakhan O O 
in O O 
autumn O O 
2017 O O 
with O O 
the O O 
“final O O 
manuscript” O O 
for O O 
a O O 
self-published O O 
book O O 
containing O O 
the O O 
photo. O O 

725824328
“I O O 
sent O O 
him O O 
a O O 
copy O O 
of O O 
the O O 
manuscript O O 
suggesting O O 
that, O O 
showing O O 
him O O 
the O O 
picture, O O 
and O O 
saying O O 
to O O 
him, O O 
if O O 
he O O 
did O O 
not O O 
object, O O 
I O O 
was O O 
going O O 
to O O 
publish O O 
it,” O O 
Muhammad O O 
said. O O 

725824328
“He O O 
had O O 
no O O 
objection.” O O 
… O O 
During O O 
Obama’s O O 
presidential O O 
campaign, O O 
conservatives O O 
pushed O O 
multiple O O 
apparently O O 
racially O O 
motivated O O 
conspiracy O O 
theories O O 
about O O 
Obama’s O O 
religion O O 
and O O 
supposed O O 
ties O O 
to O O 
Islam. O O 

725824328
For O O 
example, O O 
in O O 
Obama’s O O 
memoir O O 
subtitled O O 
A O O 
Story O O 
of O O 
Race O O 
and O O 
Inheritance, O O 
Obama O O 
recounts O O 
his O O 
being O O 
a O O 
regular O O 
reader O O 
of O O 
Minister O O 
Farrakhan’s O O 
Nation O O 
of O O 
Islam O O 
newspaper O O 
The O O 
Final O O 
Call. O O 

725824328
During O O 
the O O 
2008 O O 
presidential O O 
election, O O 
conservatives O O 
questioned O O 
the O O 
indirect O O 
ties O O 
between O O 
Farrakhan O O 
and O O 
Obama, O O 
who O O 
attended O O 
a O O 
church O O 
that O O 
gave O O 
Farrakhan O O 
an O O 
award. O O 

725824328
Jeremiah O O 
Wright O O 
gave O O 
Farrakhan O O 
his O O 
church’s O O 
Lifetime O O 
Achievement O O 
award O O 
in O O 
a O O 
downtown O O 
Chicago O O 
Hyatt O O 
Regency O O 
in O O 
November O O 
2007, O O 
but O O 
the O O 
story O O 
didn’t O O 
make O O 
the O O 
press O O 
until O O 
the O O 
following O O 
year. O O 

725824328
Similarly, O O 
very O O 
little O O 
media O O 
attention O O 
was O O 
paid O O 
to O O 
the O O 
close O O 
relationship O O 
between O O 
Obama’s O O 
fundraiser O O 
and O O 
private O O 
mentor O O 
Tony O O 
Rezko O O 
and O O 
the O O 
Nation O O 
of O O 
Islam, O O 
even O O 
though O O 
Rezko’s O O 
role O O 
was O O 
business O O 
manager O O 
for O O 
Nation O O 
of O O 
Islam O O 
assets, O O 
such O O 
as O O 
the O O 
career O O 
of O O 
Muhammad O O 
Ali. O O 

725824328
But O O 
after O O 
all, O O 
what O O 
could O O 
be O O 
more O O 
boring O O 
than O O 
a O O 
story O O 
than O O 
involves O O 
a O O 
Presidential O O 
candidate, O O 
the O Name_Calling,Labeling

794141509
But O O 
of O O 
course, O O 
since O O 
they O O 
too O O 
push O O 
political O O 
messages O O 
for O O 
profit O O 
(waaah, O Loaded_Language 
Trump!) O Loaded_Language 

794141509
as O O 
do O O 
all O O 
the O O 
other O O 
corporate O O 
media O O 
outlets O O 
out O O 
there, O O 
they O O 
changed O O 
their O O 
headline O O 
to O O 
“Facebook O O

over O O 
800 O O 
U.S. O O 
accounts O O 
and O O 
pages O O 
for O O

794141509
Of O O 
course, O O 
the O O 
best O O 
coverage O O 
of O O 
this O O 
is O O 
from…Russia. O O 

794141509
Sputnik O O 
News O O 
contacted O O 
many O O 
of O O 
the O O 
alternative O O 
journalists O O 
who O O 
were O O 
purged O O 
to O O 
get O O 
their O O 
take O O 
on O O 
what O O 
happened. O O 

794141509
You O O 
may O O 
recall O O 
that O O 
basically O O 
every O O 
blogger O O 
outside O O 
the O O 
establishment O O 
media O O 
was O O 
accused O O 
of O O 
being O O 
secretly O O 
Russian O O 
during O O 
the O O 
2016 O O 
election O O 
by O O 
the O O 
Washington O O 
Post, O O 
so O O 
perhaps O O 
actual O O 
Russians O O 
have O O 
a O O 
vested O Loaded_Language 
interest O Loaded_Language 
in O O 
the O O 
truth O O 
coming O O 
out O O 
on O O 
this O O 
topic. O O 

794141509
He O O 
said: O O 

794141509
This O O 
signifies O O 
a O O 
re-consolidation O O 
of O O 
the O O 
media. O O 

794141509
Cable O O 
news O O 
media O O 
controlled O O 
the O O 
narrative O O 
for O O 
most O O 
of O O 
modern O O 
history, O O 
but O O 
the O O 
internet O O 
has O O 
lowered O O 
that O O 
barrier O O 
to O O 
entry O O 
and O O 
allowed O O 
the O O 
average O O 
person O O 
to O O 
become O O 
the O O 
media O O 
themselves. O O 

794141509
This O O 
obviously O O 
took O O 
market O O 
share O O 
and O O 
influence O O 
away O O 
from O O 
the O O 
traditional O O 
media, O O 
and O O 
it O O 
has O O 
allowed O O 
for O O 
a O O 
more O O 
diverse O O 
public O O 
conversation. O O 

794141509
Now O O 
it O O 
seems O O 
the O O 
platforms O O 
that O O 
have O O 
monopolized O O 
the O O 
industry O O 
are O O 
favoring O O 
mainstream O O 
sources O O 
and O O 
silencing O O 
alternative O O 
voices. O O 

794141509
So O O 
now, O O 
instead O O 
of O O 
allowing O O 
more O O 
people O O 
to O O 
have O O 
a O O 
voice, O O 
these O O 
platforms O O 
are O O 
creating O O 
an O O 
atmosphere O O 
where O O 
only O O 
powerful O O 
media O O 
organizations O O 
are O O 
welcome, O O 
just O O 
as O O 
we O O 
had O O 
on O O 
cable O O 
news. O O 

794141509
People O O 
think O O 
that O O 
we O O 
are O O 
just O O 
providing O O 
an O O 
activist O O 
spin O Name_Calling,Labeling 
on O O 
the O O 
news, O O 
but O O 
they O O 
don’t O O 
see O O 
the O O 
families O O 
struggling O O 
to O O 
have O O 
their O O 
voice O O 
heard. O O 

794141509
For O O 
example, O O 
when O O 
someone O O 
is O O 
shot O O 
by O O 
police, O O 
mainstream O O 
media O O 
sources O O 
often O O 
just O O 
republish O O 
the O O 
press O O 
release O O 
from O O 
the O O 
police O O 
department, O O 
without O O 
presenting O O 
the O O 
victim’s O O 
side O O 
of O O 
the O O 
story. O O 

794141509
We O O 
give O O 
the O O 
victims O O 
and O O 
their O O 
families O O 
a O O 
voice, O O 
which O O 
is O O 
essential O O 
to O O 
keep O O 
power O O 
in O O 
check. O O 

794141509
This O O 
also O O 
goes O O 
for O O 
bigger O O 
issues O O 
like O O 
foreign O O 
policy O O 
as O O 
well; O O 
multiple O O 
full-scale O O 
invasions O O 
of O O 
Syria O O 
have O O 
been O O 
prevented O O 
because O O 
of O O 
information O O 
that O O 
the O O 
alternative O O 
media O O 
made O O 
viral. O O

more O O

it’s O O

all O O

we O O 
need O O 
to O O 
see O O 
the O O 
bigger O O 
picture O O 
here. O O 

798244842
We O O 
need O O 
to O O 
see O O 
what O O

actually O O 
is, O O 
and O O 
the O O 
past O O

798244842
Why O O 
do O O 
we O O

798244842
Why O O 
do O O 
we O O 
believe O O 
we O O 
live O O 
in O O 
a O O

when O O 
what O O

(like O O

798244842

The O O 
fact O O 
of O O 
the O O 
matter O O 
is: O O 

798244842
“The O O

The O O 
Takeaway O O 

798244842
At O O 
the O O 
same O O 
time, O O 
independent O O

represents O O 
a O O 
shift O O 
in O O 
consciousness. O O 

798244842
A O O 
shift O O 
in O O 
our O O 
perceptions, O O 
thoughts, O O 
feelings O O 
and O O 
general O O 
self-awareness O O 
about O O 
our O O 
own O O 
planet O O 
is O O 
changing, O O 
and O O 
thus, O O 
change O O 
has O O 
been O O 
sprouted O O 
in O O 
multiple O O 
different O O 
areas, O O 
including O O 
political O O 
corruption O O 
and O O 
the O Loaded_Language 
stranglehold O Loaded_Language 
it O Loaded_Language 
has O Loaded_Language 
over O Loaded_Language 
our O O 
world. O O 

798244842
We O O 
are O O 
more O O 
aware, O O 
but O O 
there O O 
is O O 
still O O 
some O O 
ways O O 
to O O 
go… O O 

798244842
A O O 
good O O 
chunk O O 
of O O 
work O O 
has O O 
been O O 
done. O O 

798244842

whatever O O

781672902
Indeed, O O 
Mueller, O O 
fully O O 
aware O O 
that O O 
there O O 
was O O 
no O O

his O O

781672902
Mueller’s O O 
investigation O O 
of O O 
Manafort O O 
has O O 
nothing O O 
to O O 
do O O 
with O O 
the O O 
Russiagate O O

line. O O 

781672902
Manafort’s O O 
alleged O O 
crimes O O 
are O O 
far O O 
outside O O 
Mueller’s O O 
mandate O O 
and O O 
took O O

if O O

did, O O 
years O O

the O O

of O O

781672902
Manafort’s O O 
conviction O O 
by O O 
a O O 
jury O O 
on O O 
8 O O 
of O O 
the O O

is O O

781672902
Manafort O O

not O O 
of O O

of O O

781672902
American O O

which O O 
is O O 
why O O 
97% O O

to O O 
misrepresent O O 
your O O

when O O 
one O O 
of O O 
the O O

is O O 
used O O 
every O O 
day O O 
by O O 
state, O O

prosecutors. O O 

781672902
Americans O O 
who O O 
believe O O 
the O O

and O O 
convictions O O 
are O O 
unaware O O

97% O O

781672902
In O O 
Manafort’s O O 
case O O 
it O O 
didn’t, O O 
or O O 
hasn’t, O O 
worked. O O 

781672902
Yet. O O 

781672902
Manafort O O 
is O O 
due O O 
for O O 
a O O 
second O O 
trial, O O 
this O O 
time O O 
for O O 
allegely O O 
acting O O 
as O O 
an O O 
unregistered O O 
foreign O O 
agent O O 
for O O 
Ukrainian O O 
interests O O 
and O O 
for O O 
making O O 
false O O 
statements O O 
not O O 
under O O 
oath O O 
to O O 
the O O 
US O O 
government. O O 

781672902
Reportedly, O O 
Manafort O O 
is O O 
being O O 
held O O 
in O O 
solitary O O 
confinement, O O 
a O O 
form O O 
of O O 
torture O O 
designed O O 
to O O 
break O O 
a O O 
person’s O O 
spirit. O O 

781672902
Like O O 
Manafort’s O O 
first O O 
trial, O O 
his O O 
second O O 
trial O O 
has O O 
nothing O O 
whatsoever O O 
to O O 
do O O 
with O O 
Russiagate, O O 
but O O 
you O O 
will O O 
never O O 
learn O O 
that O O 
from O O 
the O O 
presstitute O O 
media O O 
or O O 
from O O 
the O O 
Democratic O O 
Party. O O 

781672902
Manafort O O 
can O O 
still O O 
be O O 
coerced O O 
to O O 
say O O 
something O O 
that O O 
can O O 
be O O 
used O O 
to O O 
drive O O 
Trump O O 
from O O 
office. O O 

781672902
What O O 
about O O 
Michael O O 
Cohen, O O 
a O O 
former O O 
attorney O O 
for O O 
Trump? O O 

781672902
Mueller O O 
saw O O 
no O O 
value O O 
in O O 
the O O 
Cohen O O 
case O O 
and O O 
passed O O 
it O O 
off O O 
to O O 
a O O 
regular O O 
US O O 
attorney O O 
to O O 
prosecute. O O 

781672902
Therefore, O O 
it O O 
would O O 
appear O O 
not O O 
to O O 
be O O 
part O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Russiagate O O 
investigation. O O 

781672902
Cohen O O 
avoided O O 
a O O 
jury O O 
and O O 
said O O 
he O O 
was O O 
guilty O O 
of O O 
five O O 
counts O O 
of O O 
personal O O 
income O O 
tax O O 
evasion, O O 
one O O 
count O O 
of O O 
making O O 
a O O 
false O O 
statement O O 
to O O 
a O O 
financial O O 
institution O O 
in O O 
order O O 
to O O 
get O O 
a O O 
loan, O O 
and O O 
two O O 
counts O O 
related O O 
to O O 
illegal O O 
campaign O O 
contributions. O O 

781672902
With O O 
regard O O 
to O O 
the O O 
campagin O O 
contributions, O O 
he O O 
contradicted O O 
his O O 
previous O O 
statements. O O 

781672902
He O O 
said O O 
that O O 
on O O 
Trump’s O O 
instruction, O O 
he O O 
paid O O 
off O O 
two O O 
women O O 
who O O 
were O O 
claiming O O 
sexual O O 
affairs O O 
with O O 
Trump. O O 

781672902
Apparently, O O 
the O O 
charge O O 
is O O 
that O O 
Cohen O O 
used O O 
monies O O 
raised O O 
for O O 
a O O 
political O O 
campaign O O 
to O O 
pay O O 
off O O 
two O O 
women, O O 
who O O 
saw O O 
and O O 
capitalized O O 
on O O 
an O O 
opportunity O O 
to O O 
extort O O 
Trump O O 
for O O 
money, O O 
and O O 
this O O 
was O O 
an O O 
illegal O O 
use O O 
of O O 
the O O 
money. O O 

781672902
Nevertheless, O O 
Cohen’s O O 
plea O O 
is O O 
associated O O 
with O O 
a O O 
case O O 
brought O O 
by O O 
another O O 
prosecutor, O O 
not O O 
by O O 
Special O O 
Prosecutor O O 
Mueller. O O 

781672902
I O O 
am O O 
not O O 
sufficiently O O 
familiar O O 
with O O

legal O O

to O O 
say O O 
how O O 
this O O 
gets O O 
brought O O 
back O O 
into O O

investigation. O O

this: O O

at O O 
the O O

777869943
It's O O 
not O O 
clear O O 
whether O O 
the O O

those O O 
of O O 
Abdul-Ghani O O 
Wahhaj, O O 
a O O 
child O O 
with O O 
severe O O 
medical O O 
problems O O 
who O O 
disappeared O O 
from O O

about O O 
nine O O 
months O O

777869943
Authorities O O 
raided O O 
the O O 
compound O O 
in O O 
Amalia, O O 
New O O 
Mexico, O O 
on O O 
Friday O O 
as O O 
part O O 
of O O 
their O O 
search O O 
for O O 
Abdul-Ghani, O O 
whose O O 
father, O O 
Siraj O O 
Wahhaj, O O 
allegedly O O 
abducted O O 
him O O 
from O O 
Georgia O O 
in O O 
November. O O 

777869943
The O O 
Badgers O O 
, O O 
whose O O 
land O O 
the O O 
compound O O 
was O O 
on, O O 
said O O 
they O O 
saw O O 
a O O 
boy O O 
they O O 
thought O O 
was O O 
Abdul-Ghani O O 
in O O 
January O O 
and O O 
February. O O 

777869943
In O O 
April, O O 
they O O 
discovered O O 
the O O 
boy O O 
was O O 
listed O O 
as O O 
missing O O 
and O O 
his O O 
father O O 
a O O 
fugitive. O O 

777869943
They O O 
reported O O 
the O O 
sightings O O 
to O O 
state O O 
and O O 
local O O 
law O O 
enforcement, O O 
but O O 
it O O 
was O O 
months O O 
before O O 
police O O 
moved O O 
in, O O 
the O O 
couple O O 
said. O O 

777869943
New O O 
Mexico O O 
authorities O O 
had O O 
suspected O O 
the O O 
father O O 
and O O 
son O O 
might O O 
be O O 
at O O 
the O O 
compound O O 
after O O 
learning O O 
about O O 
the O O 
abduction O O 
in O O 
May, O O 
the O O 
sheriff O O 
said. O O 

777869943
But O O 
there O O 
was O O 
not O O 
enough O O 
evidence O O 
for O O 
a O O 
search O O 
warrant, O O 
and O O 
surveillance O O 
of O O 
the O O 
property O O 
didn't O O 
identify O O 
the O O 
pair O O 
there. O O 

777869943
"I O O 
had O O 
no O O 
probable O O 
cause O O 
to O O 
go O O 
onto O O 
this O O 
property," O O 
Hogrefe O O 
said. O O 

777869943
"In O O 
hindsight O O 
I O O 
wish O O 
there O O 
was, O O 
but O O 
we O O 
would O O 
not O O 
have O O 
been O O 
there O O 
lawfully." O O 

777869943
The O O 
sheriff O O 
said O O 
that O O 
"they O O 
did O O 
surveillance, O O 
both O O 
ground O O 
and O O 
aerial, O O 
and O O 
photographs O O 
were O O 
shared O O 
with O O 
the O O 
family O O 
and O O 
mother O O 
of O O 
the O O 
missing O O 
boy. O O 

777869943
The O O 
boy O O 
Abdul O O 
was O O 
never O O 
identified O O 
from O O 
those O O 
photos. O O 

777869943
Moving O O 
forward O O 
we O O 
knew O O 
that O O 
there O O 
was O O 
this O O 
compound, O O 
but O O 
we O O 
had O O 
very O O 
little O O 
details O O 
about O O 
it O O 
or O O 
who O O 
was O O 
occupying O O 
it. O O 

777869943
The O O 
authorities' O O 
view O O 
changed O O 
Thursday O O 
when O O 
they O O 
said O O 
they O O 
received O O 
a O O 
message O O 
about O O 
possible O O 
starving O Loaded_Language 
children O Loaded_Language 
living O O 
on O O 
the O O 
compound, O O 
and O O 
had O O 
enough O O 
probable O O 
cause O O 
to O O 
put O O 
in O O 
an O O 
affidavit O O 
for O O 
a O O 
search O O 
warrant. O O 

777869943
"We O O 
are O Loaded_Language 
starving O Loaded_Language 
and O Loaded_Language 
need O O 
food O O 
and O O 
water," O O 
the O O 
message O O 
said, O O 
according O O 
to O O 
authorities. O O 

777869943
Authorities O O 
said O O 
it O O 
was O O 
forwarded O O 
to O O 
them O O 
but O O 
did O O 
not O O 
provide O O 
details O O 
on O O 
its O O 
origin. O O 

777869943
Stacks O O 
of O O 
tires, O O 
piles O O 
of O O 
trash O O 
and O O 
plastic O O 
sheets O O 
surrounded O O 
the O O 
compound. O O 

777869943
Obscured O O 
by O O 
the O O 
junk O O 
was O O 
a O O 
trailer O O 
where O O 
the O O 
11 O O 
children O O 
and O O 
five O O 
adults O O 
were O O 
living. O O 

777869943
The O O 
father O O 
of O O 
the O O 
missing O O 
boy, O O 
Siraj O O 
Wahhaj, O O 
was O O 
arrested O O 
at O O 
the O O 
compound O O 
Friday O O 
along O O 
with O O 
his O O 
sisters O O 
Hujrah O O

two O O

-- O O 
Lucas O O 
Morten O O 
and O O

777869943
All O O 
have O O 
been O O 
charged O O 
with O O 
abuse O O 
of O O 
the O O 
11 O O 
children. O O 

777869943
Morten O O 
was O O 
charged O O 
with O O 
harboring O O 
a O O 
fugitive. O O 

777869943
The O O 
couple O O 
said O O 
they O O 
went O O 
back O O 
over O O 
the O O 
weekend O O 
after O O 
they O O 
found O O 
out O O 
Abdul-Ghani O O 
wasn't O O 
among O O 
the O O 
11 O O 
children O O 
discovered O O 
during O O 
the O O 
raid. O O 

777869943
Tanya O O 
and O O 
Jason O O 
Badger O O 
said O O 
they O O 
told O O 
authorities O O 
they O O 
had O O 
seen O O 
a O O 
boy O O 
they O O 
thought O O 
was O O 
Abdul-Ghani O O 
Wahhaj. O O 

777869943
Abdul-Ghani's O O 
mother, O O 
Hakima O O 
Ramzi, O O 
could O O 
not O O 
be O O 
reached O O 
after O O 
authorities O O 
announced O O 
the O O 
discovery O O 
of O O 
the O O 
remains. O O 

777869943
But O O 
hours O O 
earlier, O O 
Ramzi O O 
told O O 
CNN O O 
she O O 
had O O 
no O O 
idea O O 
he'd O O 
disappear O O 
with O O 
their O O 
son O O 
for O O 
nine O O 
months, O O 
only O O 
to O O 
be O O 
found O O 
across O O 
the O O 
country O O 
with O O 
11 O O 
other O O 
children O O 

777869943
"My O O 
husband O O 
said O O 
he O O 
was O O 
taking O O 
Abdul-Ghani O O 
to O O 
the O O 
park, O O 
and O O 
didn't O O 
come O O 
back. O O 

777869943
That O O 
was O O 
in O O 
November O O 
2017. O O 

777869943
When O O 
I O O 
would O O 
ask O O 
him O O 
where O O 
he O O 
was, O O 
he O O 
said O O 
he O O 
was O O 
on O O 
his O O 
way, O O 
he O O 
was O O 
coming O O 
soon, O O 
he O O 
was O O 
just O O 
keeping O O 
him O O 
for O O 
the O O 
night. O O 

777869943
But O O 
I O O 
haven't O O 
seen O O 
him O O 
since O O 
then," O O 
Ramzi O O 
said O O 
Tuesday. O O 

777869943
She O O 
said O O 
her O O 
son O O 
cannot O O 
walk O O 
and O O 
suffers O O 
seizures, O O 
and O O 
requires O O 
constant O O 
medical O O 
attention. O O 

777869943
But O O 
Ramzi O O 
said O O 
her O O 
husband O O 
was O O 
planning O O 
to O O 
perform O O 
a O O 
ruqya O O 
-- O O 
an O O 
Islamic O O 
practice O O 
involving O O 
prayer O O 
that O O 
is O O 
believed O O 
to O O 
help O O 
rid O O 
a O O 
body O O 
of O O 
illness. O O 

777869943
"It's O O

That O O

court," O O 
Ramzi O O 
said. O O 

777869943
He O O 
"just O O 
wanted O O 
to O O 
pray O O 
for O O 
Abdul-Ghani O O 
to O O 
get O O 
better." O O 

777869943
Police O O 
stopped O O 
the O O 
father O O 
in O O 
Alabama O O 

777869943
In O O 
December, O O 
days O O 
after O O 
Ramzi O O 
reported O O 
her O O 
son O O 
missing, O O 
the O O 
child's O O 
father O O 
was O O 
involved O O 
in O O 
an O O 
accident O O 
in O O 
Alabama, O O 
according O O 
to O O 
a O O 
police O O 
report. O O 

777869943
The O O 
SUV O O 
had O O 
seven O O 
children O O 
-- O O 
but O O 
none O O 
of O O 
them O O 
was O O 
listed O O 
with O O 
Abdul-Ghani's O O 
date O O 
of O O 
birth. O O 

777869943
Siraj O O 
Wahhaj O O 
is O O 
accused O O 
of O O 
fleeing O O 
Georgia O O 
with O O 
his O O 
young O O 
son. O O 

777869943
But O O 
at O O 
the O O 
time, O O 
the O O 
group O O 
told O O 
Alabama O O 
police O O 
they O O 
were O O 
headed O O 
to O O 
New O O 
Mexico O O 
for O O 
camping, O O 
and O O 
continued O O 
on O O 
their O O 
way. O O 

777869943
Even O O 
though O O 
the O O 
boy O O 
was O O 
reported O O 
missing, O O 
there O O 
was O O 
no O O 
child O O 
abduction O O 
warrant O O 
against O O 
Wahhaj O O 
because O O 
he O O 
was O O 
married O O 
to O O 
his O O 
son's O O 
mother, O O 
and O O 
they O O 
both O O 
had O O 
equal O O

Clayton O O 
County O O

said. O O 

777869943
The O O 
SUV O O 
was O O 
registered O O 
to O O 
Leveille, O O 
who O O 
was O O 
also O O 
in O O 
the O O

777869943
She O O

there O O 
is O O 
no O O

that O O 
she O O 
did O O 
kill O O 
him. O O 

788271400
This O O 
is O O 
a O O 
fact. O O 

788271400
Because O O 
of O O

this O O

no O O

788271400
That, O O

788271400
At O O

788271400

are O O 
treating O O

because O O 
she O O 
is O O 
part O O

788271400
But O O 
that O O 
is O O 
not O O 
the O O

From O O 
the O O 
beginning O O 
of O O 
this O O 
case, O O 
it O O 
was O O 
clear O O 
that O O 
Guyger O O 
was O O 
receiving O O 
special O O 
treatment O O 
from O O 
law O O

who O O

a O O

in O O

area O O 
sums O O 
up O O 
the O O 
treatment O O 
of O O 
Guyger O O 
perfectly O O 
when O O 
he O O 
says O O 
that O O 
“The O O 
affidavit O O 
isn’t O O 
written O O 
objectively, O O 
not O O 
at O O 
the O O 
slightest. O O 

787966255
As O O 
stated O O 
before, O O 
they O O 
are O O 
usually O O 
wholly O O 
against O O 
the O O 
accused. O O 

787966255
An O O 
objective O O 
view O O 
of O O 
the O O 
information O O 
related O O 
by O O 
the O O 
officer O O 
would O O 
be O O 
proper, O O 
in O O 
my O O 
opinion. O O 

787966255
This O O 
affidavit O O 
states O O 
facts O O 
based O O 
upon O O 
the O O 
word O O 
of O O 
the O O 
person O O 
it O O 
seeks O O 
to O O 
accuse O O 
of O O 
criminal O O 
wrongdoing.” O O 

787966255
What’s O O 
more, O O 
according O O 
to O O 
WFAA, O O 
who O O 
obtained O O 
affidavits O O 
for O O 
all O O 
of O O 
the O O 
search O O 
warrants O O 
involved O O 
in O O 
the O O 
case, O O 
none O O 
of O O 
them O O 
involved O O 
the O O 
search O O 
of O O 
Guyger’s O O 
apartment. O O 

787966255
They O O 
attempted O O 
to O O 
assassinate O Loaded_Language 
Jean’s O O 
character O O 
by O O 
claiming O O 
they O O 
found O O 
less O O 
than O O 
a O O 
half O O 
ounce O O 
of O O 
weed O O 
in O O 
his O O 
apartment. O O 

787966255
One O O 
thing O O 
in O O 
particular, O O 
however, O O 
stood O O 
out O O 
to O O 
those O O 
paying O O 
attention O O 
and O O 
that O O 
is O O 
the O O 
fact O O 
the O O 
police O O 
didn’t O O 
release O O 
any O O 
information O O 
on O O 
what O O 
they O O 
found O O 
in O O 
Guyger’s O O 
apartment. O O 

787966255
According O O 
to O O 
the O O 
information O O 
currently O O 
available, O O 
that’s O O 
because O O 
they O O 
didn’t O O 
search O O 
it. O O 

787966255
According O O 
to O O 
WFAA, O O 
there O O 
were O O 
five O O

issued O O 
in O O 
the O O 
case—none O O 
of O O 
which O O 
were O O

787966255

In O O

Sheriff O O

“That O O

the O O

sent O O

We O O 
also O O 
knew O O 
from O O 
the O O

both O O

the O O

“I O O

788847916
But O O

say O O 
this O O 
is O O 
not O O

788847916
As O O 
WFAA O O 
reports, O O 
Justin O O 
Moore, O O 
a O O 
civil O O 
rights O O 
attorney O O 
was O O 
a O O 
panelist O O 
at O O 
the O O 
meeting O O 
and O O 
was O O 
surprised O O 
by O O 
the O O 
Chief’s O O 
comments. O O 

788847916
“I O O 
was O O 
completely O Loaded_Language 
mystified, O Loaded_Language 
and O O 
I O O 
really O O 
didn’t O O 
understand O O 
where O O 
it O O 
came O O 
from O O 
last O O 
night. O O 

788847916
WFAA O O 
went O O 
further O O 
and O O 
noted O O 
that O O 
the O O 
“the O O 
Dallas O O 
Police O O 
Department O O 
general O O 
orders O O 
do O O 
allow O O 
the O O 
chief O O 
to O O 
take O O 
action, O O 
saying, O O 
‘The O O 
Chief O O 
of O O 
Police O O 
may O O 
circumvent O O 
all O O 
formal O O 
disciplinary O O 
procedures O O 
to O O 
render O O 
an O O 
immediate O O 
decision O O 
when O O 
it O O 
deems O O 
it O O 
necessary O O 
to O O 
preserve O O 
the O O 
integrity O O 
of O O 
the O O 
department.’” O O 

788847916
As O O 
WFAA O O 
pointed O O 
out, O O 
lots O O 
of O O 
cops O O 
across O O 
the O O 
state O O 
who O O 
have O O 
been O O 
under O O 
criminal O O 
investigation O O 
have O O 
been O O 
fired O O 
by O O 
police O O 
chiefs. O O 

788847916
This O O 
includes O O 
cops O O 
within O O 
the O O 
Dallas O O 
police O O 
department. O O 

788847916
Days O O 
later, O O 
after O O 
her O O 
account O O 
was O O 
found O O 
to O O 
be O O 
entirely O O 
false, O O 
she O O 
was O O 
fired O O 
for O O 
it. O O 

788847916
Days O O 
later, O O 
he O O 
was O O 
also O O 
fired O O 
after O O 
surveillance O O 
video O O 
proved O O 
he O O 
was O O 
lying O O 
about O O 
what O O 
happened. O O 

788847916
Like O O 
all O O 
those O O 
accused O O 
of O O 
a O O 
crime, O O 
Amber O O 
Guyger O O 
deserves O O 
her O O 
day O O 
in O O 
court. O O 

788847916
However, O O 
as O O 
far O O 
as O O 
her O O 
job O O 
with O O 
the O O 
department O O 
is O O 
concerned, O O 
she O O 
has O O 
already O O 
proven O O 
that O O 
she O O 
is O O 
no O O 
longer O O 
fit O O 
for O O 
duty, O O 
ever O O 
again. O O 

788847916
WFAA O O 
asked O O 
the O O 
Dallas O O 
Police O O 
Department O O 
for O O 
the O O 
laws O O 
she O O 
cited O O 
claiming O O 
that O O 
she O O 
can’t O O 
fire O O 
Guyger, O O 
but O O 
they O O 
did O O 
not O O 
provide O O 
them. O O 

788847916
The O O 
department O O 
did O O 
respond O O 
about O O 
the O O 
general O O 
order O O 
mentioned O O 
by O O 
WFAA, O O 
however, O O 
saying, O O 
“General O O 
order O O 
508 O O 
refers O O 
to O O 
the O O 
Police O O 
Chief’s O O 
ability O O 
to O O 
circumvent O O 
the O O 
formal O O 
disciplinary O O 
procedures O O 
not O O 
the O O 
investigative O O 
process.” O O 

788847916
At O O 
the O O 
very O O 
least, O O 
she O O 
should O O 
be O O 
fired O O 
for O O 
this. O O

why O O 
did O O 
Osborne O O 
do O O 
this, O O 
according O O 
to O O

763114850
The O O

“was O O 
executed O O 
after O O

Aggression O O 
Intensifies O O 

699478811
The O O 
next O O 
day O O 
the O O 
Iranian O O 
regime O O 
warned O O 
of O O 
a O Loaded_Language 
"crushing" O Loaded_Language 
response O Loaded_Language 
if O Loaded_Language 
the O O 
United O O 
States O O 
were O O 
to O O 
designate O O 
the O O 
IRGC O O 
as O O 
a O O 
terrorist O O 
organization. O O 

699478811
President O O 
Trump O O 
has O O 
called O O 
the O O 
Iranian O O 
regime’s O O 
bluff O O 
with O O 
his O O 
announcement O O 
last O O 
week O O 
that O O 
he O O 
would O O 
do O O 
just O O 
that. O O 

699478811
Designating O O 
the O O 
IRGC O O 
as O O 
a O O 
terrorist O O 
organization O O 
and O O 
imposing O O 
new O O 
sanctions O O 
for O O 
its O O 
aggressive O Loaded_Language 
actions O O 
in O O 
the O O 
region O O 
is O O 
not O O 
a O O 
restoration O O 
of O O 
the O O 
sanctions O O 
lifted O O 
by O O 
the O O 
Obama O O 
administration O O 
as O O 
part O O 
of O O 
its O O 
disastrous O Loaded_Language 
nuclear O O 
deal O O 
with O O 
Iran. O O 

699478811
If O O 
Iran O O 
insists O O 
it O O 
can O O 
do O O 
what O O 
it O O 
wants O O 
militarily O O 
in O O 
terms O O 
of O O 
missile O O 
launches, O O 
support O O 
of O O 
terrorist O O 
groups O O 
such O O 
as O O 
Hezbollah O O 
and O O 
Hamas, O O 
and O O 
arms O O 
transfers O O 
without O O 
violating O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
deal, O O 
then O O 
the O O 
United O O 
States O O 
can O O 
certainly O O 
act O O 
to O O 
curb O O 
such O O 
activities O O 
through O O 
financial O O 
pressure. O O 

699478811
The O O 
U.S. O O 
can O O 
impose O O 
sanctions O O 
against O O 
the O O 
Iranian O O 
regime’s O O 
principal O O 
instrument O O 
for O O 
projecting O O 
aggressive, O Loaded_Language 
destabilizing O Loaded_Language 
force O O 
outside O O 
of O O 
its O O 
borders O O 
without O O 
violating O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
deal. O O 

699478811
The O O 
Iranian O O 
regime O O 
does O O 
not O O 
see O O 
it O O 
that O O 
way, O O 
however. O O 

699478811
With O O 
the O O 
lifting O O 
of O O 
the O O 
nuclear-related O O 
sanctions O O 
making O O 
available O O 
billions O O 
of O O 
dollars O O 
to O O 
Iran’s O O 
leaders O O 
to O O 
further O O 
finance O O 
the O O 
IRGC’s O O 
exploits O O 
in O O 
Iraq, O O 
Syria, O O 
Lebanon, O O 
Yemen O O 
and O O 
elsewhere, O O 
the O O 
regime O O 
is O O 
furious O Loaded_Language 
that O O 
the O O 
Trump O O 
administration O O 
is O O 
tightening O O 
the O O 
financial O O 
screws O O 
again, O O 
even O O 
if O O 
for O O 
reasons O O 
not O O 
directly O O 
related O O 
to O O 
Iran’s O O 
compliance O O 
with O O 
the O O 
terms O O 
of O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
deal. O O 

699478811
On O O 
Tuesday, O O 
Major O O 
General O O 
Bagheri O O 
landed O O 
in O O 
Damascus O O 
for O O 
talks O O 
with O O 
Syrian O O 
President O O 
Bashar O O 
Assad O O 
and O O 
senior O O 
Syrian O O 
officials, O O 
including O O 
the O O 
defense O O 
minister O O 
and O O 
the O O 
chief O O 
of O O 
staff O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Syrian O O 
armed O O 
forces. O O 

699478811
Bagheri O O 
is O O 
quoted O O 
as O O 
saying O O 
that O O 
his O O 
visit’s O O 
purpose O O 
was O O 
to O O 
“put O O 
a O O 
joint O O 
strategy O O 
on O O 
continuing O O 
co-ordination O O 
and O O 
co-operation O O 
at O O 
the O O 
military O O 
level.” O O 
Some O O 
experts O O 
on O O 
Iran O O 
believe O O 
that O O 
Bagheri’s O O 
visit O O 
to O O 
Damascus O O 
at O O 
this O O 
time O O 
is O O 
intended O O 
to O O 
reinforce O O 
a O O 
message O O 
that O O 
Iran O O 
will O O 
continue O O 
to O O 
supply O O 
weaponry O O 
to O O 
Syria O O 
and O O 
to O O 
reinforce O O 
the O O 
presence O O 
of O O 
its O O 
terrorist O O 
proxy O O 
Hezbollah O O 
in O O 
Syria. O O 

699478811
Meanwhile, O O 
following O O 
the O O 
departure O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Kurds O O 
from O O 
Kirkuk, O O 
Iraq O O 
earlier O O 
this O O 
week, O O 
the O O 
IRGC’s O O 
operational O O 
Al O O 
Qods O O 
arm O O 
reportedly O O 
established O O 
a O O 
command O O 
center O O 
and O O 
five O O 
bases O O 
there. O O 

699478811
According O O 
to O O 
Debkafile, O O 
this O O 
constitutes O O 
“the O O 
first O O 
military O O 
facility O O 
Iran O O 
has O O 
ever O O 
established O O 
openly O O 
in O O 
Iraq.” O O 
The O O 
Kirkuk O O 
region O O 
holds O O 
45 O O 
percent O O 
of O O 
Iraqi’s O O 
oil. O O 

699478811
It O O 
is O O 
against O O 
this O O 
backdrop O O 
that O O 
U.S. O O 
ambassador O O 
to O O 
the O O 
United O O 
Nations O O 
Nikki O O 
Haley O O 
used O O 
her O O 
entire O O 
speech O O 
to O O 
the O O 
UN O O 
Security O O 
Council O O 
on O O 
Wednesday O O 
to O O 
denounce O O 
the O O 
Iranian O O 
regime O O 
on O O 
multiple O O 
grounds. O O 

699478811
The O O 
session O O 
was O O 
supposed O O 
to O O 
be O O 
devoted O O 
to O O 
the O O 
Israeli-Palestinian O O 
conflict, O O 
but O O 
Ambassador O O 
Haley O O 
departed O O 
from O O 
the O O 
monthly O O 
ritual O O 
during O O 
which O O 
Israel O O 
is O O 
normally O O 
singled O O 
out O O 
for O O 
criticism O O 
by O O 
other O O 
Council O O 
members. O O 

699478811
She O O 
went O O 
after O O 
Iran O O 
instead. O O 

699478811
She O O 
explained O O 
why O O 
the O O 
Trump O O 
administration O O 
decided O O 
to O O 
take O O 
“a O O 
comprehensive O O 
approach O O 
to O O 
confronting O O 
the O O 
Iranian O O 
regime,” O O 
which O O 
does O O 
not O O 
give O O 
the O O 
regime O O 
a O O 
get O Loaded_Language 
out O Loaded_Language 
of O Loaded_Language 
jail O Loaded_Language 
free O Loaded_Language 
card O Loaded_Language 
even O O 
if O O 
it O O 
is O O 
in O O 
technical O O 
compliance O O 
with O O 
the O O 
loophole-ridden O Loaded_Language 
nuclear O O 
deal O O 
agreed O O 
to O O 
by O O 
the O O 
Obama O O 
administration. O O 

699478811
“We O O 
can’t O O 
talk O O 
about O O 
stability O O 
in O O 
the O O 
Middle O O 
East O O 
without O O 
talking O O 
about O O 
Iran,” O O 
Ambassador O O 
Haley O O 
said. O O 

699478811
The O O 
United O O 
States O O 
has O O 
now O O 
embarked O O 
on O O 
a O O 
course O O 
that O O 
attempts O O 
to O O 
address O O 
all O O 
aspects O O 
of O O 
Iran’s O O 
destructive O Loaded_Language 
conduct, O O 
not O O 
just O O 
one O O 
aspect. O O 

699478811
It’s O O 
critical O O 
that O O 
the O O 
international O O 
community O O 
do O O 
the O O 
same. O O 

699478811
Judging O O 
Iran O O 
by O O 
the O O 
narrow O O 
confines O O 
of O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
deal O O 
misses O O 
the O O 
true O O 
nature O O 
of O O 
the O O 
threat. O O 

699478811
Ambassador O O 
Haley O O 
accused O O 
the O O 
Iranian O O 
regime O O 
of O O 
continuing O O 
to O O 
“play” O Loaded_Language 
the O O 
Security O O 
Council. O O 

699478811
“Iran O O 
hides O O 
behind O O 
its O O 
assertion O O 
of O O 
technical O O 
compliance O O 
with O O 
the O O 
nuclear O O 
deal O O 
while O O 
it O O 
brazenly O Loaded_Language 
violates O Loaded_Language 
the O O 
other O O 
limits O O 
on O O 
its O O 
behavior. O O 

699478811
And O O 
we O O 
have O O 
allowed O O 
them O O 
to O O 
get O O 
away O O 
with O O 
it. O O 

699478811
This O O 
must O O 
stop.” O O 

699478811
Ambassador O O 
Haley O O 
proceeded O O 
to O O 
list O O 
various O O 
violations O O 
by O O 
the O O 
Iranian O O 
regime O O 
of O O

resolutions O O 
pertaining O O 
to O O 
the O O

of O O

the O O

of O O 
terrorist O O 
groups, O O 
including O O 
the O O 
Houthi O O 
rebels O O 
in O O 
Yemen O O 
and O O 
Hezbollah. O O 

699478811
“If O O 
it O O 
is O O 
wrong O O 
for O O

to O O 
do O O 
this, O O 
why O O 
doesn’t O O 
that O O

“ O O

(IAEA) O O 
Director O O 
General O O 
Yukiya O O

that O O

to O O 
the O O 
IAEA’s O O 
capacity O O

check O O 
whether O O

was O O 
conducting O O

on O O 
a O O 
nuclear O O 
explosive O O 
device, O O 
his O O 
agency’s O O 
“tools O O

The O O 
Iranian O O 
regime O O 
has O O 
also O O 
attempted O O 
to O O 
skirt O O 
the O O 
restrictions O O 
in O O

related O O 
to O O

what O O

the O O

making O O 
up O O

either O O

The O O

have Repetition O 
no O O

there O O 
are O O 
no O O 
emergency O O 
procedures, O O 
and O O 
their O O 
original O O

of O O

711716996
But O O 
basically, O O 
Saris O O 
wants O O 
the O O 
illegal Repetition O

the Repetition O 
opportunity O O 
to O O 
submit O O 
another O O

will O O 
take O O

adjudicate O O 
those O O

711716996
The O O 
only O O 
claim O O 
they O O 
have O O 
before O O 
a O O 
Federal O O

is O O 
if O O 
they O O

the O O

generally O O 
filed O O

applications O O 
after O O 
arriving O O 
in O O

711716996
This O O

711716996
This O O 
is O O 
important O O 
in O O 
that O O 
while O O 
there O O 
was O O 
anti-Chinese O O 
and O O 
anti-Christian O O 
violence, O O 
the O O 
non-Chinese O O

mostly O O 
stuck O O 
around, O O 
though O O 
the O O

Fast O O 
forward O O

these O O

among O O 
millions O O

are O O 
allowed O O 
to O O

and O O 
then O O

711716996
And O O

said O O 
his O O 
public O O 
apology O O 
for O O 
his O O 
affair O O 
with O O 
White O O 
House O O 
intern O O 
Monica O O

was O O 
enough. O O

NBC’s O O 
“Today” O O 
show O O 
correspondent O O 
Craig O O 
Melvin O O 
asked O O 
Clinton O O 
in O O 
an O O 
interview O O 
aired O O 
Monday O O 
if O O 
he O O 
had O O 
ever O O 
apologized O O 
to O O 
Lewinsky, O O 
who O O 
was O O 
22 O O 
and O O 
Clinton’s O O 
subordinate O O 
when O O 
they O O 
began O O 
an O O 
affair O O 
more O O 
than O O 
two O O 
decades O O 
ago. O O 

761575506
“I O O 
apologized O O 
to O O 
everybody O O 
in O O 
the O O 
world,” O O 
Clinton O O 
said O O 
of O O 
his O O 
public O O 
apology. O O 

761575506
Melvin O O 
followed O O 
up O O 
by O O 
asking O O 
Clinton O O 
if O O 
he O O 
had O O 
ever O O 
apologized O O 
privately. O O 

761575506
“I O O 
have O O 
never O O 
talked O O 
to O O 
her. O O 

761575506
But O O 
I O O 
did O O 
say O O 
publicly O O 
on O O 
more O O 
than O O 
one O O 
occasion O O 
that O O 
I O O 
was O O 
sorry. O O 

761575506
That’s O O 
very O O 
different. O O 

761575506
The O O 
apology O O 
was O O 
public,” O O 
he O O 
said. O O

Clinton O O 
made O O 
his O O 
public O O 
apology O O 
in O O

way O O 
to O O

that O O

he O O 
said O O 
there. O O 

761575506
Clinton O O 
told O O 
Melvin O O 
that O O 
at O O 
the O O 
time O O 
the O O 
affair O O 
became O O 
public, O O 
“I O O 
felt O O 
terrible O O 
then O O 
and O O 
I O O 
came O O 
to O O 
grips O O 
with O O 
it.” O O 
He O O 
said O O 
later O O 
in O O 
the O O 
interview: O O 
“I O O 
dealt O O 
with O O 
it O O 
20 O O 
years O O 
ago O O 
plus O O 
… O O 
I’ve O O 
tried O O

a O O 
good O O

since O O 
then O O 
with O O 
my O O 
life O O 
and O O 
my O O 
work.” O O 

761575506
Clinton O O 
also O O 
said O O 
that O O 
he O O 
did O O 
not O O 
regret O O 
his O O 
decision O O 
to O O 
fight O O 
impeachment, O O 
and O O 
noted O O 
that O O 
he O O 
left O O 
the O O 
White O O

$16 O O 
million O O 
in O O 
debt O O 
from O O

In O O 
an O O

response O O 
to O O 
the O O

Lewinsky O O 
tweeted O O 
Monday O O 
that O O

As O O 
Miller O O 
documented, O O 
this O O 
official O O 
— O O 
whom O O 
the O O 
paper O O 
did O O 
not O O 
name O O 
because O O 
she O O 
was O O 
a O O 
covert O O 
agent O O 
at O O 
the O O 
time O O 
— O O 
was O O 
centrally O O 
involved O O 
in O O 
the Exaggeration,Minimisation O

regime. Slogans O 

738361208
Even O O 
more O O 
troubling, O O 
she O O 
“had O O 
run O O 
a O O 
secret O O 
prison O O 
in O O 
Thailand” O O 
— O O 
part O O 
of O O 
the O O 
CIA’s O O 
network O O 
of O O 
“black O O 
sites” O O 
— O O 
“where O O 
two O O 
detainees O O 
were O O 
subjected O O 
to O O 
waterboarding O O 
and O O 
other O O 
harsh Loaded_Language O 
techniques.” Loaded_Language O 
The O O 
Senate O O 
Intelligence O O 
Committee’s O O 
report O O 
on O O 
torture O O 
also O O 
detailed O O 
the O O 
central O O 
role O O 
she O O 
played O O 
in O O 
the O O 
particularly O Loaded_Language 
gruesome Loaded_Language Loaded_Language

of Loaded_Language O

738361208
Following O O 
what O O 
has O O 
appeared O O 
for O O 
months O O 
to O O 
be O O 
a O O 
strained O O 
relationship O O 
between O O 
President O O 
Donald O O 
Trump O O 
and O O 
Secretary O O 
of O O 
State O O 
Rex O O 
Tillerson, O O 
the O O 
top O O 
diplomat O O 
is O O 
being O O 
replaced. O O 

738361208
Trump O O 
announced O O 
Tillerson’s O O 
ouster O O 
via O O 
Twitter O O 
Tuesday, O O 
saying: O O 
“Mike O O 
Pompeo, O O 
Director O O 
of O O 
the O O 
CIA, O O 
will O O 
become O O 
our O O 
new O O 
Secretary O O 
of O O 
State. O O 

738361208
Thank O O 
you O O 
to O O 
Rex O O 
Tillerson O O 
for O O 
his O O 
service! O O 

738361208
Gina O O 
Haspel O O 
will O O 
become O O 
the O O 
new O O 
Director O O 
of O O 
the O O 
CIA, O O 
and O O 
the O O 
first O O

so O O 
chosen. O O 

738361208
Congratulations O O 
to O O 
all!” O O

The O Doubt 
move O Doubt 
creates O Doubt 
some O Doubt 
big O Doubt

foreign O Doubt 
policy O Doubt 
ambitions O Doubt 
as O Doubt 
well O Doubt 
as O Doubt

with O Doubt

state. O Doubt 

738361208
If O Causal_Oversimplification 
you O Causal_Oversimplification 
enjoyed O Causal_Oversimplification 
Hillary O Causal_Oversimplification 
Clinton’s O Causal_Oversimplification 
tenure O Causal_Oversimplification 
as O Causal_Oversimplification 
Secretary O Causal_Oversimplification 
of O Causal_Oversimplification 
State, O Causal_Oversimplification 
you’ll O Causal_Oversimplification 
like O Causal_Oversimplification 
Pompeo’s. O Causal_Oversimplification 

738361208
Like O O 
Clinton O O 
and O O 
her O O 
Democrat O O 
allies, O O 
Pompeo O O 
has O O 
long O O 
subscribed O O 
to O O 
the O O 
belief O O 
that O O 
Russia O Loaded_Language 
is O Loaded_Language 
perpetually O Loaded_Language 
meddling O Loaded_Language 
in O Loaded_Language 
U.S. O O 
affairs. O O 

738361208
Pompeo O Flag-Waving 
also O Flag-Waving 
isn’t O Flag-Waving 
a O Flag-Waving 
huge O Flag-Waving 
fan O Flag-Waving 
of O Flag-Waving 
calling O Flag-Waving 
the O Flag-Waving 
federal O Flag-Waving 
government O Flag-Waving 
out O Flag-Waving 
when O Flag-Waving 
it O Flag-Waving 
is O Flag-Waving 
clearly O Flag-Waving 
violating O Flag-Waving 
the O Flag-Waving 
rights O Flag-Waving 
of O Flag-Waving 
Americans, O Flag-Waving 
as O O 
shown O O 
by O O 
his O O 
statements O O 
last O O 
year O O 
regarding O O 
WikiLeaks. O O 

738361208
In O O 
January O O 
of O O 
this O O 
year, O O 
our O O 
Intelligence O O 
Community O O 
determined O O 
that O O 
Russian O O 
military O O 
intelligence O O 
— O O 
the O O 
GRU O O 
— O O 
had O O 
used O O 
WikiLeaks O O 
to O O 
release O O 
data O O 
of O O 
U.S. O O 
victims O O 
that O O 
the O O 
GRU O O 
had O O 
obtained O O 
through O O 
cyber O O 
operations O O 
against O O 
the O O 
Democratic O O 
National O O 
Committee. O O 

738361208
And O O 
the O O 
report O O 
also O O 
found O O 
that O O 
Russia’s O O 
primary O O 
propaganda O O 
outlet, O O 
RT, O O 
has O O 
actively O O 
collaborated O O 
with O O 
WikiLeaks,” O O 
he O O 
said. O O

Moving O O 
on O O 
to O O

who O O 
will O O 
now O O 
be O O

nothing’s O Thought-terminating_Cliches

738361208
IN O O 
MAY O O 
2013, O O 
the O O 
Washington O O 
Post’s O O 
Greg O O 
Miller O O 
reported O O 
that O O 
the O O 
head O O 
of O O 
the O O 
CIA’s O O 
clandestine O O 
service O O 
was O O 
being O O 
shifted O O 
out O O 
of O O 
that O O 
position O O 
as O O 
a O O 
result O O 
of O O 
“a O O 
management O O 
shake-up” O O 
by O O 
then-Director O O 
John O O 
Brennan. O O 

738361208
As O O 
Miller O O 
put O O 
it, O O 
she O O 
was O O 
“directly O O 
involved O O 
in O O 
its O O 
controversial O O 
interrogation O O 
program” O O 
and O O 
had O O 
an O O 
“extensive O O 
role” O O 
in O O 
torturing O O 
detainees. O O 

738361208
Beyond O O 
all O O 
that, O O 
she O O 
played O O 
a O O 
vital O O 
role O O 
in O O 
the O O 
destruction O O 
of O O 
interrogation O O 
videotapes O O 
that O O 
showed O O 
the O O 
torture O O 
of O O 
detainees O O 
both O O 
at O O 
the O O 
black O O 
site O O 
she O O 
ran O O 
and O O 
other O O 
secret O O 
agency O O 
locations. O O 

738361208
The O O 
concealment O O 
of O O 
those O O 
interrogation O O 
tapes, O O 
which O O 
violated O O 
multiple O O 
court O O 
orders O O 
as O O 
well O O 
as O O 
the O O 
demands O O 
of O O 
the O O 
9/11 O O 
commission O O 
and O O 
the O O 
advice O O 
of O O 
White O O 
House O O 
lawyers, O O 
was O O 
condemned O O 
as O O 
“obstruction” O O 
by O O 
commission O O 
chairs O O 
Lee O O 
Hamilton O O 
and O O 
Thomas O O 
Keane. O O 

738361208
A O O 
special O O 
prosecutor O O 
and O O 
grand O O 
jury O O 
investigated O O 
those O O 
actions O O 
but O O 
ultimately O O 
chose O O 
not O O 
to O O 
prosecute. O O

when O O 
you O O

misconstrue O O 
the O O

it O O

they O O

just O O 
correct O O 
it, O O 
they O O 
removed O O 
it O O

because O O 
they O O

we O O 
rate O O

left O O

999001280
We O O

surrendered O O

the O O

that O O

However, O O 
a O O 
federal O O

in O O 
a O O 
lawsuit O O 
brought O O 
by O O 
eight O O

the O O

has O O 
blocked O O

776126299
The O O

should O O 
understand O O 
that O O 
these O O

are O O 
protected O O 
under O O 
the O O 
First O O

in O O 
the O O 
same O O

that O O 
any O O

and O O 
that O O 
there O O

Second, O O 
if O O 
that O O 
were O O 
not O O 
enough, O O 
we O O

that O O

reached O O 
by O O

allowing O O

776126299
Trump O O

that O O 
he's O O 
"looking O O

"doesn't O O

776126299
Why, O Loaded_Language 
yes, O O 
yes O O 
they O O 
are O O 
serious. O O 

776126299
The O O 
eight O O

are O O 
the O O

along O O 
with O O

Washington's O O 
Attorney O O 
General O O 
Bob O O 
Ferguson's O O 
office O O 
claims O O 
the O O 
settlement O O 
is: O O 

776126299
...in O O 
violation O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Administrative O O 
Procedure O O 
Act....there O O 
is O O 
no O O 
indication O O 
in O O 
the O O 
settlement O O 
agreement O O 
or O O 
elsewhere O O 
that O O 
any O O 
analysis, O O 
study O O 
or O O 
determination O O 
was O O 
made O O 
by O O 
the O O 
government O O 
defendants O O 
in O O 
consultation O O 
with O O 
other O O 
agencies, O O 
before O O 
the O O 
federal O O 
government O O 
agreed O O 
to O O 
lift O O 
export O O 
controls O O 
on O O 
the O O 
downloadable O O 
guns. O O 

776126299
In O O 
fact, O O 
the O O 
agreement O O 
states O O 
that O O 
it O O 
"does O O 
not O O 
reflect O O 
any O O 
agreed-upon O O 
purpose O O 
other O O 
than O O 
the O O 
desire O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Parties O O 
to O O 
reach O O 
a O O 
full O O 
and O O 
final O O 
conclusion O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Action, O O 
and O O 
to O O 
resolve O O 
the O O 
Action O O 
without O O 
the O O 
time O O 
and O O 
expense O O 
of O O 
further O O 
litigation." O O 

776126299
The O O 
lawsuit O O 
also O O 
argues O O 
the O O 
settlement O O 
violates O O 
the O O 
Tenth O O 
Amendment O O 
by O O 
infringing O O 
on O O 
states' O O 
rights O O 
to O O 
regulate O O 
firearms. O O 

776126299
Washington O O 
has O O 
a O O 
robust O O 
regulatory O O 
system O O 
meant O O 
to O O 
keep O O 
firearms O O 
out O O 
of O O 
the O O 
hands O O 
of O O 
dangerous O O 
individuals. O O 

776126299
That O O 
system O O 
is O O 
jeopardized O O 
by O O 
the O O 
Trump O O 
Administration's O O 
action O O 
and O O 
will O O 
be O O 
undermined O O 
by O O 
the O O 
distribution O O 
of O O 
Defense O O 
Distributed's O O 
downloadable O O 
guns. O O 

776126299
Note O O 
that O O 
Ferguson O O 
forgets O O 
that O O 
the O O 
Tenth O O 
Amendment O O 
states O O 
plainly: O O 

776126299
The O O 
powers O O 
not O O 
delegated O O 
to O O 
the O O 
United O O

by O O 
the O O 
Constitution, O O 
nor O O 
prohibited O O 
by O O 
it O O 
to O O 
the O O

are O O 
reserved O O

776126299
Josh O O

one O O

today O O 
that O O 
"The O O

776126299

776126299
As O O

776126299
(Both O O

776126299
While O O 
the O O

suggest O O 
that O O 
August O O

the O O 
date O O 
on O O 
which O O 
Defense O O 
Distributed O O 
will O O 
begin O O 
distributing O O 
the O O

again, O O 
the O O 
settlement O O 
legally O O 
permits O O 
them O O 
to O O 
do—the O O 
distribution O O 
is O O 
already O O 
happening. O O 

776126299
Cody O O

already O O 
fundraising O O

776126299
He O O 
told O O 
me O O 
five O O 
years O O 
ago, O O 
when O O 
I O O 
was O O 
writing O O 
a O O

on O O 
the O O 
beginnings O O 
of O O 
his O O 
fight O O 
with O O 
the O O 
government O O 
over O O 
gun-making O O

that O O 
"This O O 
has O O 
been O O 
a O O 
continuous O O 
process O O 
of O O 
different O O

of O O

figures O O 
trying O O 
to O O

thus O O 
allowing O O

happen...Of O O

we O O 
are O O 
going O O 
to O O 
succeed—because O O 
you O O 
all O O 
are O O 
trying O O

stop O O 
me. O O 

776126299
That O O 
seemed O O 
natural O O 
and O O 
ended O O 
up O O 
being O O 
true." O O 

776126299
So O O 
far, O O 
that O O

I O O 
went O O 
ahead O O 
and O O 
added O O 
up O O 
each O O 
column, O O 
and O O 
what O O 
I O O 
discovered O O 
is O O 
that O O 
264 O O 
cases O O 
of O O 
sexual O O 
harassment O O 
in O O 
Congress O O 
have O O 
been O O 
settled O O 
since O O

and O O 
the O O 
total O O 
amount O O 
awarded O O 
in O O 
those O O

comes O O 
to O O 
a O O 
grand O O 
total O O 
of O O 
$17,250,854. O O 

708561738
So O O 
where O O 
has O O 
the O O 
$17,250,854 O O 
come O O 
from O O 
to O O 
pay O O 
those O O 
settlements? O O 

708561738
When O O 
U.S. O O 
Representative O O 
Jackie O O 
Speier O O 
originally O O 
told O O 
us O O 
that O O 
more O O 
than O O 
15 O O 
million O O 
dollars O O 
had O O 
been O O 
paid O O 
out O O 
to O O 
victims O O 
of O O 
sexual O O 
harassment O O 
in O O 
recent O O 
years, O O 
I O O 
was O O 
envisioning O O 
a O O 
few O O 
dozen O O 
cases O O 
at O O 
most. O O 

708561738
I O O 
had O O 
no O O 
idea O O 
that O O 
the O O 
total O O 
number O O 
of O O 
cases O O 
would O O 
actually O O 
be O O 
well O O 
over O O 
200. O O 

708561738
If O O 
our O Flag-Waving 
leaders O O 
were O O 
serious O O 
about O O 
stopping O O 
this O O 
from O O 
happening, O O 
they O O 
would O O 
pass O O 
a O O 
law O O 
making O O 
it O O 
mandatory O O 
that O O 
all O O 
cases O O 
of O O 
sexual O O 
harassment O O 
in O O 
Congress O O 
be O O 
made O O 
public, O O 
and O O 
that O O 
members O O 
of O O 
Congress O O 
would O O 
be O O 
personally O O 
responsible O O 
for O O 
paying O O 
out O O 
any O O 
settlements. O O 

708561738
But O O 
they O O 
don’t O O 
want O O 
it O O 
to O O 
stop. O O 

708561738

I O O

708561738

that O O

to O O

708561738

I O O

calling O O

immediately O O 
release O O

can O O 
kill O O 
a O O

experts O O 
warn O O 
that O O 
its O O 
too O O

that O O

708487008
A O O

708487008
The O O 
best O O 
way O O

a O O 
report O O 
written O O 
by O O 
Susan O O 
Ellingstad, O O 
a O O 
lawyer O O 
hired O O 
by O O 
Minnesota's O O 
Democratic-Farmer-Labor O O 
Party O O 
to O O 
investigate O O 
the O O

"The O O 
investigation O O 
report, O O 
which O O 
was O O 
released O O 
today O O 
without O O 
our O O 
knowledge O O 
by O O 
someone O O 
outside O O 
of O O 
our O O 
organization, O O 
was O O 
unable O O 
to O O 
substantiate O O 
the O O 
claim O O 
of O O 
physical O O 
abuse O O 
made O O 
by O O 
Ms. O O 
Monahan,” O O 
DFL O O 
Chairman O O 
Ken O O 
Martin O O 
said O O 
in O O 
a O O 
statement. O O 

111111123
Martin O O 
said O O 
they O O 
planned O O 
to O O 
turn O O 
over O O 
the O O 
report O O 
to O O 
local O O 
law O O 
enforcement. O O 

111111123
“For O O 
the O O 
purpose O O 
of O O 
objectivity O O 
and O O 
getting O O 
all O O 
of O O 
the O O 
facts O O 
regarding O O 
these O O 
allegations, O O 
we O O 
have O O 
decided O O 
to O O 
forward O O 
the O O 
information O O 
in O O 
the O O 
investigation O O 
to O O 
local O O 
authorities O O 
in O O 
order O O 
to O O 
let O O 
them O O 
review O O 
the O O 
contents O O 
and O O 
determine O O 
whether O O 
further O O 
investigation O O 
is O O 
warranted,” O O 
Martin O O 
said. O O 

111111123
The O O 
Democratic O O 
congressman, O O 
who O O 
serves O O 
as O O 
deputy O O 
chairman O O 
of O O 
the O O 
Democratic O O 
National O O 
Committee, O O 
has O O 
denied O O 
the O O 
allegations. O O 

111111123
In O O 
a O O 
statement, O O 
Ellison O O 
thanked O O 
Ellingstad O O 
for O O 
conducting O O 
a O O 
"thorough, O O 
independent, O O 
and O O 
fair O O 
review." O O 

111111123
"I O O 
believe O O 
women O O 
who O O 
come O O 
forward O O 
must O O 
be O O 
heard, O O 
and O O 
to O O 
have O O 
their O O 
allegations O O 
fully O O 
investigated," O O 
Ellison O O 
said. O O 

111111123
"This O O 
is O O 
why O O 
I O O 
have O O 
complied O O 
with O O 
this O O 
investigation O O 
fully, O O 
and O O 
will O O 
do O O 
so O O 
with O O 
any O O 
other O O 
inquiries. O O 

111111123
... O O 
At O O 
this O O 
time, O O 
I O O 
will O O 
be O O 
focusing O O 
on O O 
the O O 
issues O O 
of O O 
this O O 
important O O 
election." O O 

111111123
Ellison’s O O 
ex-girlfriend, O O 
Karen O O 
Monahan, O O 
alleged O O 
in O O 
August O O 
that O O 
Ellison O O 
dragged O O 
her O O 
off O O 
a O O 
bed O O 
by O O 
her O O 
feet O O 
while O O 
screaming O O 
obscenities O O 
at O O 
her O O 
in O O 
2016. O O 

111111123
Monahan O O 
said O O 
she O O 
had O O 
video O O 
footage O O 
of O O 
the O O 
incident O O 
and O O 
levied O O 
the O O 
allegation O O 
just O O 
days O O 
ahead O O 
of O O 
a O O 
crowded O O 
Democratic O O 
primary O O 
for O O 
Minnesota O O 
attorney O O 
general O O 
that O O 
Ellison O O 
went O O 
on O O 
to O O 
win. O O 

111111123
The O O 
state's O O 
Democratic O O 
party O O 
launched O O 
an O O 
investigation O O 
into O O 
the O O 
claim, O O 
retaining O O 
a O O 
local O O 
attorney O O 
with O O 
links O O 
to O O 
the O O 
state O O 
party O O 
to O O 
determine O O 
whether O O 
the O O 
alleged O O 
incident O O 
took O O 
place. O O 

111111123
Democratic O O 
party O O 
chairman O O 
Ken O O 
Martin O O 
said O O 
last O O 
week O O 
he O O 
expected O O 
the O O 
investigation O O 
to O O 
conclude O O 
soon. O O 

111111123
A O O 
draft O O 
report O O 
obtained O O 
by O O 
the O O 
AP O O 
noted O O 
Monahan's O O 
shifting O O 
rationale O O 
for O O 
refusing O O 
to O O 
produce O O 
the O O 
video O O 
footage, O O 
including O O 
that O O 
it O O 
was O O 
lost, O O 
was O O 
on O O 
a O O 
USB O O 
drive O O 
in O O 
storage O O 
and O O 
would O O 
be O O 
too O O 
embarrassing O O 
and O O 
traumatic O O 
to O O 
release O O 
it. O O 

111111123
The O O 
Ellison O O 
accusations O O 
have O O 
put O O 
Democrats O O 
in O O 
an O O 
uncomfortable O O 
position, O O 
as O O 
they O O 
speak O O 
out O O 
on O O 
sexual O O 
misconduct O O 
claims O O 
against O O 
Supreme O O 
Court O O 
nominee O O 
Brett O O 
Kavanaugh. O O 

111111123
Kavanaugh O O 
denies O O 
the O O 
accusations. O O 

111111123
Monahan O O 
slammed O Loaded_Language 
the O O 
Democratic O O 
Party O O 
for O O 
its O O 
response O O 
to O O 
her O O 
allegations O O 
when O O 
compared O O 
to O O 
its O O 
treatment O O 
of O O 
Christine O O 
Blasey O O 
Ford. O O 

111111123
Ford O O 
has O O 
accused O O 
Kavanaugh O O 
of O O 
attempting O O 
to O O 
force O O 
himself O O 
onto O O 
her O O 
during O O 
a O O 
high O O 
school O O 
party O O 
nearly O O 
four O O 
decades O O 
ago. O O 

111111123
Many O O 
prominent O O 
Democrats O O 
have O O 
supported O O 
Ford’s O O 
allegations. O O 

111111123
“No, O O 
they O O 
don't,” O O 
Monahan O O 
tweeted O O 
in O O 
response O O 
to O O 
a O O 
question O O 
of O O 
whether O O 
the O O 
party O O 
believes O O 
women’s O O 
stories. O O 

111111123
“I've O O 
been O O 
smeared, O Loaded_Language 
threatened, O Loaded_Language 
isolated O O 
from O O 
my O O 
own O O 
party. O O 

111111123
I O O 
provided O O 
medical O O 
records O O 
from O O 
2017, O O 
stating O O 
on O O 
two O O 
different O O 
Dr. O O 

111111123
Visits, O O 
I O O 
told O O 
them O O 
about O O 
the O O 
abuse O O 
and O O 
who O O 
did O O 
it. O O 

111111123
My O O 
therapist O O 
released O O 
records O O 
stating O O 
I O O 
have O O 
been O O 
dealing O O 
and O O 
healing O O 
from O O 
the O O 
abuse.” O O 

111111123
She O O 
added: O O 
“Four O O 
people, O O 
including O O 
my O O 
supervisor O O 
at O O 
the O O 
time, O O 
stated O O 
that O O 
I O O 
came O O 
to O O 
them O O 
after O O 
and O O 
shared O O 
the O O 
exact O O 
story O O 
I O O 
shared O O 
publicly, O O 
I O O 
shared O O 
multiple O O 
text O O 
between O O 
me O O 
and O O 
Keith, O O 
where O O 
I O O 
discuss O O 
the O O 
abuse O O 
with O O 
him O O 
and O O 
much O O 
more. O O 

111111123
As O O 
I O O 
said O O 
before, O O 
I O O 
knew O O 
I O O 
wouldn't O O 
be O O 
believed.” O O 

111111123
Many O O 
other O O 
Democrats O O 
and O O 
progressives O O 
– O O 
who O O 
largely O O 
stayed O O 
silent O O 
after O O 
the O O 
accusations O O 
against O O 
Ellison O O 
emerged O O 
– O O 
came O O 
out O O 
in O O 
support O O 
of O O 
Ford, O O 
including O O 
Vermont O O 
Sen. O O 
Bernie O O 
Sanders O O 
and O O 
Tom O O 
Perez, O O 
chairman O O 
of O O 
the O O 
DNC, O O 
who O O 
urged O O 
to O O 
investigate O O 
the O O 
claims O O 
and O O 
Kavanaugh. O O 

111111123
Monahan O O 
went O O 
to O O 
reiterate O O 
that O O 
her O O 
story O O 
has O O 
nothing O O 
to O O 
do O O 
with O O 
politics. O O 

111111123
“I O O 
have O O 
nothing O O 
to O O 
prove O O 
to O O 
anyone, O O 
I O O 
simply O O 
shared O O 
my O O 
story. O O
